A first principles exploration of how knowledge emerges across disciplines, designed for deep understanding and synthesis. This blog examines the causal mechanisms that unite seemingly disparate fields, revealing the elegant structures that govern everything from quantum mechanics to biological systems.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) using the minimal Chiri theme, optimized for mathematical content with KaTeX support.

## Philosophy

> _Rigor. Clarity. Simplicity. Wonder._

Science is not a collection of facts, but a method of interventionâ€”a systematic way of asking universal questions and interpreting observations. Mathematics serves as our universal language for encoding these discoveries, allowing understanding to transcend cultural and linguistic boundaries.

## Featured Content

Current posts explore cutting-edge topics in theoretical physics and mathematics:

- **Black Hole Horizons and Dimensional Reduction Correspondence**
- **Conservation, Dissipation, and Field Emergence**
- **Fourier Transforms and the Uncertainty Principle**
- **Golden Ratio and Prime Resonance in Quantum Transport**
- **The Thermodynamic Computational Speed Limit**
- **Type Ia Supernova Information-Theoretic Energetics**

## Technical Features

- [x] Built with Astro for optimal performance
- [x] Responsive design with light/dark mode

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended package manager)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kurtkemple/scienceandmathematics.com.git
cd scienceandmathematics.com
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Content Management

- **New posts**: `pnpm new "Post Title"` (use `_title` for drafts)
- **Configuration**: Edit `src/config.ts` for site settings
- **About page**: Modify `src/content/about/about.md`
- **Posts**: Add markdown files to `src/content/posts/`

### Deployment

The site is configured for Netlify deployment with the `@astrojs/netlify` adapter. For other platforms:

- **Vercel**: `pnpm add @astrojs/vercel` and update `astro.config.ts`
- **Cloudflare Pages**: `pnpm add @astrojs/cloudflare` and update `astro.config.ts`
- **Static hosting**: `pnpm add @astrojs/static` and update `astro.config.ts`

Refer to [Astro Deployment Guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for detailed instructions.
