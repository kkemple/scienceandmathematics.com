A first principles exploration of how knowledge emerges across disciplines, designed for deep understanding and synthesis. $\Phi$

Science is not a collection of facts, but a method of intervention—a systematic way of asking universal questions and interpreting observations. Mathematics serves as our universal language for encoding these discoveries, allowing understanding to transcend cultural and linguistic boundaries.

Here, we examine the causal mechanisms that unite seemingly disparate fields, revealing the elegant structures that govern everything from quantum mechanics to biological systems.

_Rigor. Clarity. Simplicity. Wonder._
