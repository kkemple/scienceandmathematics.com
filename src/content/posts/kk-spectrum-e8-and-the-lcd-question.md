zenodoDescription: |
  The scalar Kaluza–Klein spectrum on the Poincaré homology sphere Σ = S³/2I is computed by evaluating the exact branching rules SU(2) → 2I, where 2I is the binary icosahedral group (order 120, the largest finite subgroup of SU(2)). Among the first 30 spin values (l = 0 through l = 29), exactly 15 survive the orbifold projection and 15 are forbidden.

  The forbidden set coincides with the gap set of the numerical semigroup ⟨6, 10, 15⟩, generated by the halved degrees of the Klein invariant polynomials associated with the E₈ singularity. This is proved as a theorem: for any finite Γ ⊂ SU(2), the forbidden KK levels on S³/Γ are the gaps of the semigroup generated by the halved Klein invariant degrees. The semigroup has Frobenius number F = 29 and genus g = 15 = h/2, where h = 30 is the Coxeter number. All eight E₈ exponents appear among the forbidden levels.

  The eigenvalue counting function N(λ) exhibits a Weyl exponent crossover at the Coxeter threshold: d_eff ≈ 2.55 in the semigroup-controlled regime (l ≤ 29), crossing to d_eff → 3 asymptotically, verified to 0.3% at l = 500. The orbifold is topologically three-dimensional but spectrally behaves as dimension ~2.55 at low energies.

  Comparison across four ADE branches (E₈, E₇, E₆, D₈) reveals a protection factor hierarchy: 56× (E₈), 27× (E₇), 16× (E₆), 8× (D₈). The identity g = h/2 holds only for E₈. The Penrose branch is extremal in protection and maximal in Frobenius-to-Coxeter ratio (F/h = 0.967).

  The 6D embedding dimension (Kramer–Neri) and the E₈ algebraic structure (McKay correspondence) answer different questions: 6D is the minimum lattice dimension for icosahedral projection; E₈ governs the compactification geometry through 2I → Klein invariants → E₈ singularity.

The projection from a 6D periodic lattice to 3D produces a quasicrystal in physical space and an orbifold $S^3/\mathrm{2I}$—the Poincaré homology sphere—in the internal space. The [constraint geometry](/triadic-tension-decade-symmetry-and-dissipation-flow-in-constraint-geometry) and the spectral content of this orbifold are two outputs of that single projection. The constraint geometry provides the $\beta$-function. The spectral content provides the effective dimension $\mathcal{D}$ that enters the $\beta$-function's dimensional correction. The full chain connecting these is developed in [From Lattice Projection to Cosmic Expansion](/from-lattice-projection-to-cosmic-expansion). This post computes the scalar Kaluza–Klein spectrum on $S^3/\mathrm{2I}$.

## 1. The Internal Space

The binary icosahedral group $\mathrm{2I} \cong \mathrm{SL}(2,5)$ is the double cover of the icosahedral rotation group $\mathrm{I} \cong A_5$. It has 120 elements—the largest finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$—and acts freely on $S^3 \simeq \mathrm{SU}(2)$ by left multiplication. The quotient $\Sigma = S^3/\mathrm{2I}$ is a smooth, compact, oriented three-manifold with $\pi_1(\Sigma) = \mathrm{2I}$ and $H_1(\Sigma;\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Poincaré constructed it in 1904 as a counterexample to the conjecture that homology determines the three-sphere[^1]. It is the unique spherical space form with icosahedral holonomy.

In a Kaluza–Klein compactification on $\Sigma$, the scalar field equation reduces to the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace–Beltrami operator $\Delta_\Sigma$. The eigenvalues of $\Delta_{S^3}$ on the unit three-sphere are

$$
\lambda_k = k(k+2), \qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots,
$$

with degeneracy $(k+1)^2$[^2]. Each eigenspace carries the representation $D_{k/2} \otimes D_{k/2}$ of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ under the Peter–Weyl decomposition of $L^2(\mathrm{SU}(2))$, where $D_j$ denotes the spin-$j$ irreducible representation of dimension $2j+1$[^3][^4].

On $\Sigma = S^3/\mathrm{2I}$, scalar wavefunctions must be $\mathrm{2I}$-invariant under the left action. Since $-I \in \mathrm{2I}$ acts as $(-1)^k$ on $D_{k/2}$, only even values $k = 2l$ contribute (integer spin $j = l$). For each surviving spin $l$, the eigenvalue is

$$
\lambda_l = 4l(l+1),
$$

and the full orbifold multiplicity is

$$
m_l = (2l+1) \cdot n_l,
$$

where the factor $(2l+1)$ comes from the unbroken $\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ action on the opposite Peter–Weyl factor, and $n_l$ counts the $\mathrm{2I}$-invariant vectors in the spin-$l$ representation. The KK mass tower is therefore determined by the branching multiplicities $n_l$.

## 2. Branching Rules

The group $\mathrm{2I}$ has nine conjugacy classes. Each element $g \in \mathrm{2I} \subset \mathrm{SU}(2)$ has eigenvalues $e^{\pm i\alpha}$ in the fundamental representation, where $\alpha \in [0, \pi]$ is the half-angle parameter.

| Class | Size | Order | $\alpha$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $\{1\}$ | 1 | 1 | $0$ |
| $\{-1\}$ | 1 | 2 | $\pi$ |
| $C_{10}$ | 12 | 10 | $\pi/5$ |
| $C_5$ | 12 | 5 | $2\pi/5$ |
| $C_{10}'$ | 12 | 10 | $3\pi/5$ |
| $C_5'$ | 12 | 5 | $4\pi/5$ |
| $C_6$ | 20 | 6 | $\pi/3$ |
| $C_3$ | 20 | 3 | $2\pi/3$ |
| $C_4$ | 30 | 4 | $\pi/2$ |

The total is $1 + 1 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 20 + 20 + 30 = 120$. The character of the spin-$l$ representation of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ at half-angle $\alpha$ is

$$
\chi_l(\alpha) = \frac{\sin((2l+1)\alpha)}{\sin(\alpha)},
$$

with $\chi_l(0) = 2l+1$ and $\chi_l(\pi) = (-1)^{2l}(2l+1)$. The multiplicity of the trivial representation of $\mathrm{2I}$ in the restriction of spin-$l$ is

$$
n_l = \frac{1}{120} \sum_{i} |C_i| \, \chi_l(\alpha_i),
$$

where the sum runs over the nine conjugacy classes $C_i$ with half-angle parameters $\alpha_i$. This is an exact finite sum over nine terms.

## 3. The Spectrum

Evaluating $n_l$ for $l = 0$ through $l = 120$ partitions the spectrum into three regimes.

**Below the Coxeter number** ($l < 30$): The tower is sparse. Of the 30 spin values $l = 0, \ldots, 29$, exactly 15 survive with $n_l = 1$, and 15 are forbidden with $n_l = 0$. The surviving spin values are

$$
l \in \{0, 6, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28\}.
$$

The forbidden spin values are

$$
l \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 23, 29\}.
$$

**At and above the Coxeter number** ($30 \leq l \leq 59$): Every spin value is present. The invariant count begins to increase: $n_{30} = 2$, the first level carrying two independent $\mathrm{2I}$-invariants. Below $l = 30$, every surviving mode has $n_l = 1$; the transition at $l = 30$ marks both the onset of completeness and the first multiplicity enhancement.

**Asymptotics** ($l \gg 30$): The invariant count satisfies $n_l \to (2l+1)/120$ on average, and the full multiplicity $m_l = (2l+1) \cdot n_l \to (2l+1)^2/120$, recovering the expected $1/|\mathrm{2I}|$ factor relative to $S^3$.

The first massive mode occurs at $l = 6$, with eigenvalue $\lambda_6 = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 = 168$. The five consecutive forbidden levels $l = 1, \ldots, 5$ create the largest gap in the tower. The eigenvalue gap between the zero mode ($\lambda = 0$) and the first excitation ($\lambda = 168$) is a factor of 56 above the generic $S^3$ first excitation at $k = 1$ ($\lambda = 3$). This protection factor—56×—is the largest among all finite subgroup quotients of $S^3$.

| $l$ | $k = 2l$ | $\lambda = k(k+2)$ | $n_l$ | $m_l$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 6 | 12 | 168 | 1 | 13 |
| 10 | 20 | 440 | 1 | 21 |
| 12 | 24 | 624 | 1 | 25 |
| 15 | 30 | 960 | 1 | 31 |

## 4. The Numerical Semigroup

The forbidden spin values have algebraic structure. The generators $\{6, 10, 15\}$ are the degrees of the Klein invariant polynomials for $\mathrm{2I}$ acting on $\mathbb{C}^2$, divided by two. Klein showed that the ring of polynomial invariants $\mathbb{C}[x,y]^{\mathrm{2I}}$ is generated by three homogeneous polynomials[^5]:

$$
f_{12} \text{ (degree 12)}, \qquad H_{20} \text{ (degree 20)}, \qquad T_{30} \text{ (degree 30)},
$$

satisfying the single relation $T_{30}^2 = H_{20}^3 - 1728 \, f_{12}^5$. This relation defines the $E_8$ simple singularity in the ADE classification of du Val singularities[^6]. The factor of two between the Klein degrees $\{12, 20, 30\}$ and the semigroup generators $\{6, 10, 15\}$ arises because the Molien series counts invariants at polynomial degree $k$, while the spin quantum number is $l = k/2$.

Define the numerical semigroup

$$
S = \langle 6, 10, 15 \rangle = \left\{ 6a + 10b + 15c \;\middle|\; a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \right\}.
$$

Its gap set is

$$
\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \setminus S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 23, 29\}.
$$

The semigroup has Frobenius number $F = 29$ (the largest gap) and genus $g = 15$ (the number of gaps). The identity $g = h/2$—the genus equals half the Coxeter number—is specific to the $E_8$ case (§7).

**Theorem (Semigroup selection rule).** *Let $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{SU}(2)$ be a finite subgroup and let $d_1, \ldots, d_r$ be the degrees of the homogeneous generators of the invariant ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]^{\Gamma}$. Define the numerical semigroup $S = \langle d_1/2, \ldots, d_r/2 \rangle$. Then the spin-$l$ representation of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ contains a $\Gamma$-invariant vector ($n_l \geq 1$) if and only if $l \in S$. Equivalently, the forbidden KK levels on $S^3/\Gamma$ are the gaps of $S$.*

*Proof.* The Molien series for $\Gamma$ acting on $\mathrm{Sym}^{\bullet}(\mathbb{C}^2)$ is

$$
M(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \dim\!\left(\mathrm{Sym}^k(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\Gamma}\right) t^k = \frac{P(t)}{\prod_{i=1}^r (1 - t^{d_i})},
$$

where $P(t)$ encodes the relations among the generators[^5][^7]. Under the identification $\mathrm{Sym}^{2l}(\mathbb{C}^2) \cong D_l$, the coefficient of $t^{2l}$ in $M(t)$ equals $n_l$. Writing $M(t)$ in the variable $u = t^2$ gives $\widetilde{M}(u) = \sum_{l \geq 0} n_l \, u^l$, whose denominator is $\prod_i (1 - u^{d_i/2})$. The set of exponents $l$ with $n_l \geq 1$ is the numerical semigroup generated by the denominator exponents $d_i/2$[^8], and the set with $n_l = 0$ is its gap set. For $\Gamma = \mathrm{2I}$, the Molien series specializes to

$$
M(t) = \frac{1 - t^{60}}{(1 - t^{12})(1 - t^{20})(1 - t^{30})},
$$

and $S = \langle 6, 10, 15 \rangle$ with gap set identical to the forbidden KK levels. $\square$

The theorem reduces the determination of forbidden KK levels to a purely algebraic problem: given $\Gamma$, look up the Klein invariant degrees and compute the gap set of the resulting semigroup. The character sum is required only for multiplicities $n_l > 1$ above the Coxeter threshold.

## 5. The $E_8$ Exponents

The $E_8$ root system has eight exponents $m_i$ defined by the eigenvalues of the Coxeter element: $e^{2\pi i m_i/h}$ where $h = 30$. The exponents are

$$
\{m_i\} = \{1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\}.
$$

All eight $E_8$ exponents appear among the 15 forbidden KK levels. The remaining seven forbidden levels are $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14\}$, which complete the gap set of the semigroup. The $E_8$ exponents are the integers $m \in [1, h-1]$ coprime to $h = 30$[^8]: $\gcd(m, 30) = 1$. Since $30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5$, the exponents avoid multiples of 2, 3, and 5—they are maximally incompatible with the generator structure $\{6, 10, 15\} = \{2 \times 3, \; 2 \times 5, \; 3 \times 5\}$ and the hardest gaps to fill by semigroup combinations.

The $E_8$ exponents have a dual role: they are both the eigenvalue phases of the Coxeter element in the root system and a distinguished subset of the forbidden KK harmonics on the Poincaré homology sphere. The McKay correspondence[^7]—the bijection between finite subgroups of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and simply-laced Dynkin diagrams—provides the bridge. Under this correspondence, the representation graph of $\mathrm{2I}$ has the connectivity of the extended $\hat{E}_8$ Dynkin diagram. The KK spectrum inherits $E_8$ structure because the branching problem and the McKay graph encode the same algebraic data.

## 6. The Coxeter Threshold

The Coxeter number $h = 30$ marks a sharp transition in spectral structure. Below $l = 30$, the density of surviving modes increases stepwise:

| Range | Surviving | Total | Density |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $[0, 6)$ | 1 | 6 | 0.17 |
| $[6, 12)$ | 2 | 6 | 0.33 |
| $[12, 18)$ | 3 | 6 | 0.50 |
| $[18, 24)$ | 4 | 6 | 0.67 |
| $[24, 30)$ | 5 | 6 | 0.83 |
| $[30, 60)$ | 30 | 30 | 1.00 |

The transition at $l = 30$ is also the first appearance of $n_l = 2$: the second independent $\mathrm{2I}$-invariant harmonic appears at the same threshold where the tower achieves completeness. Below the Coxeter number, every surviving mode has a single invariant ($n_l = 1$).

## 7. Spectral Dimension and Weyl Scaling

The Weyl counting function $N(\lambda) = \#\{\text{eigenvalues} \leq \lambda\}$, counted with multiplicity, satisfies

$$
N(\lambda) \sim \frac{\mathrm{Vol}(\Sigma)}{6\pi^2} \, \lambda^{3/2}
$$

asymptotically on any Riemannian three-manifold $\Sigma$[^9]. For $\Sigma = S^3/\mathrm{2I}$ with unit radius, $\mathrm{Vol}(\Sigma) = 2\pi^2/120$, giving a Weyl coefficient of $1/360$. At spin $l = 500$ ($\lambda = 1{,}002{,}000$), the Weyl prediction is $N_{\mathrm{Weyl}} \approx 2{,}786{,}115$, while the exact count gives $N_{\mathrm{exact}} = 2{,}794{,}378$—a ratio of 1.003, confirming the multiplicity formula and three-dimensional Weyl asymptotics to within 0.3%.

Restricting the fit to the sparse regime below the Coxeter number yields a different exponent:

| Regime | $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ | $R^2$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Region I ($6 \leq l \leq 29$) | 2.552 | 0.993 |
| Region II ($30 \leq l \leq 120$) | 2.974 | 0.9999 |
| Deep asymptotic ($200 \leq l \leq 500$) | 2.995 | 1.000 |

The deficit $\Delta d_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 0.45$ between Region I and the asymptotic regime arises from the semigroup sparsity: 50% of spin values are forbidden in $[0, 30)$, each surviving level contributes multiplicity $(2l+1) \times 1$, and the resulting growth of $N(\lambda)$ is sub-Weyl.

The running Weyl exponent—computed cumulatively from $l = 6$ up to successive cutoffs—shows the crossover:

| Up to spin $l$ | $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ |
|:---:|:---:|
| 15 | 2.17 |
| 20 | 2.36 |
| 29 | 2.55 |
| 30 | 2.57 |
| 50 | 2.75 |
| 100 | 2.87 |
| 200 | 2.93 |
| 500 | 2.97 |

The crossover from $\sim$2.55 to $\sim$3.0 occurs in a window around the Coxeter number. The Poincaré homology sphere is topologically three-dimensional everywhere, but its low-energy spectral content is thinner than a generic three-manifold. The semigroup gap structure creates a spectral bottleneck: modes are absent, and the cumulative eigenvalue count grows as if the manifold had effective dimension $\sim$2.55. Above $h$, all levels are present, degeneracies grow normally, and standard Weyl behavior recovers. The crossover at $l = h$ is a spectral signature of the $E_8$ algebraic structure imprinted on the geometry.

## 8. Branch Comparison

The semigroup structure generalizes across the ADE classification. For each binary polyhedral group $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{SU}(2)$, the Klein invariant ring has specific generator degrees, and the KK gap set on $S^3/\Gamma$ is controlled by the corresponding semigroup.

| | Penrose ($\mathrm{2I}$) | Octahedral ($\mathrm{2O}$) | Tetrahedral ($\mathrm{2T}$) | Dodecagonal ($\mathrm{BD}_6$) |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| McKay type | $E_8$ | $E_7$ | $E_6$ | $D_8$ |
| Group order | 120 | 48 | 24 | 24 |
| Coxeter $h$ | 30 | 18 | 12 | 14 |
| Klein degrees | 12, 20, 30 | 8, 12, 18 | 6, 8, 12 | 4, 12, 14 |
| Semigroup | $\langle 6,10,15 \rangle$ | $\langle 4,6,9 \rangle$ | $\langle 3,4,6 \rangle$ | $\langle 2,7 \rangle$ |
| Forbidden levels | 15 | 6 | 3 | 3 |
| Frobenius $F$ | 29 | 11 | 5 | 5 |
| Genus $g$ | 15 | 6 | 3 | 3 |
| $g = h/2$? | yes | no | no | no |
| First excited $\lambda$ | 168 | 80 | 48 | 24 |
| Protection factor | 56× | 27× | 16× | 8× |
| $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ Region I | 2.55 | 2.65 | 2.67 | 2.47 |

The Penrose branch is extremal in protection—56× versus 8× for the dodecagonal branch—but intermediate in Weyl deficit. The dodecagonal branch has a larger deficit (0.53 vs 0.45) despite having far fewer forbidden levels. The explanation is geometric: $\mathrm{BD}_6$ has only 24 elements, so $S^3/\mathrm{BD}_6$ has 5× the volume of $S^3/\mathrm{2I}$, and the 3 missing levels create a proportionally larger distortion in a shorter Coxeter window ($h = 14$ vs 30).

The cases $E_6$ and $D_8$ have the same group order, genus ($g = 3$), and Frobenius number ($F = 5$), yet their forbidden sets differ: $\{1, 2, 5\}$ for $E_6$ versus $\{1, 3, 5\}$ for $D_8$. These produce distinct protection factors (16× vs 8×) and distinct Region I effective dimensions (2.67 vs 2.47). The placement of the gap set within the spectral tower, not merely its cardinality or Frobenius number, governs the low-energy effective dimension.

For the binary dihedral family (McKay type $D_n$, $n \geq 4$), the semigroup generators reduce to $\langle 2, p \rangle$ with $p$ the unique odd generator. The gap set is $\{1, 3, 5, \ldots, p-2\}$—the first $g = (p-1)/2$ odd integers—so the first excitation occurs uniformly at $l = 2$ ($\lambda = 24$, protection factor 8×) for the entire family. As $n \to \infty$, $F/h \to 1/2$ and $g/h \to 1/4$, so $g = h/2$ is never achieved in the $D$-family.

For $E_8$, the genus equals $h/2$ exactly. The three generators $\{6, 10, 15\}$ are pairwise coprime ($\gcd(6,10) = 2$, $\gcd(6,15) = 3$, $\gcd(10,15) = 5$, while $\gcd(6,10,15) = 1$), producing a maximally sparse semigroup for the given generator sizes. The normalized Frobenius number $F/h = 29/30 = 0.967$—algebraic protection extends through nearly the entire Coxeter range. For $D_8$, $F/h = 5/14 = 0.357$. The Penrose branch is the unique ADE branch whose spectral protection saturates nearly the full window below $h$.

## 9. The LCD Question

The negative selection argument in the [constraint geometry](/triadic-tension-decade-symmetry-and-dissipation-flow-in-constraint-geometry) forces $C_{10}$ as the discrete sector symmetry. The 6D lattice is the minimum embedding dimension for a periodic lattice whose projection to $\mathbb{R}^3$ carries icosahedral symmetry (Kramer–Neri, 1984[^10]). The $E_8$ algebraic structure enters through a separate channel: $C_{10}$ on $S^3$ gives $\mathrm{2I}$, and $\mathrm{2I}$ acting on $\mathbb{C}^2$ gives Klein invariants of degrees 12, 20, 30 satisfying $T^2 = H^3 - 1728f^5$—the $E_8$ singularity. The McKay correspondence confirms the identification. Every link is a theorem.

The two dimensions answer different questions. 6D is the minimum embedding dimension for the periodic parent lattice that projects to a 3D icosahedral quasicrystal—standard quasicrystallography. $E_8$ (whose root lattice lives in 8D) is the algebraic structure governing the compactification geometry. It enters through the McKay correspondence, which identifies finite subgroups of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ with ADE Dynkin diagrams, and determines the spectral content of $S^3/\mathrm{2I}$: which KK modes survive, how the gap set is organized, and what effective dimension the low-energy spectrum carries.

The chain is forced. Negative selection gives $C_{10}$. $C_{10}$ on $S^3$ gives $\mathrm{2I}$. $\mathrm{2I}$ acting on $\mathbb{C}^2$ gives the Klein invariants. The Klein invariants satisfy the $E_8$ surface equation. The McKay correspondence confirms the identification. The spectral content—15 forbidden levels, protection factor 56×, genus $= h/2$, Frobenius number 29—follows from the invariant ring structure alone.

## 10. Attack Surface

The computation rests on the character orthogonality formula applied to the known conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{2I}$[^11]. The conjugacy class data—sizes, orders, and half-angle parameters—are standard results in the representation theory of finite groups. The semigroup identification is verified by direct enumeration up to $l = 500$; discrepancy at any single level would falsify the correspondence.

The equivalence between the branching multiplicities $n_l$ and the Molien series is a theorem—it follows from the identification of $\mathrm{2I}$-invariant spherical harmonics with $\mathrm{2I}$-invariant homogeneous polynomials via the restriction map $\mathrm{Sym}^{2l}(\mathbb{C}^2) \to L^2(S^3)$. The semigroup structure of the gap set then follows from the structure of the invariant ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]^{\mathrm{2I}}$ as a graded algebra with three generators and one relation.

The multiplicity formula $m_l = (2l+1) \cdot n_l$ follows from the Peter–Weyl decomposition: the eigenspace at KK level $k = 2l$ decomposes as $D_l^L \otimes D_l^R$ under $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(2)_R$, with $\mathrm{2I}$ acting on one factor. The invariant subspace retains the full $(2l+1)$-dimensional representation on the opposite factor. This is confirmed by the Weyl law check at $l = 500$: the predicted count $N \approx 2{,}786{,}115$ matches the computed $N = 2{,}794{,}378$ to within 0.3%.

The Weyl exponent fits are standard log-log regressions with 14 data points in Region I and 301 in the deep asymptotic regime. The deficit $d_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 2.55$ is robust to variations in the fitting window and quantifies spectral thinning caused by the semigroup gap structure.

The computation does not address whether $S^3/\mathrm{2I}$ appears as an internal space in any consistent compactification of string theory or supergravity. The Poincaré homology sphere is not Kähler, not Calabi–Yau, and not a group manifold. The spectral results reported here follow from representation theory alone and hold for any scalar field equation on $S^3/\mathrm{2I}$ with the round metric. The extension to $p$-form spectra (vectors, spinors, symmetric tensors) requires analogous branching rules and has not been carried out.

The dynamical selection question—whether the $E_8$ branch is favored over competing ADE branches—is addressed in [ADE Domain Walls and Branch Selection](/ade-domain-walls-and-branch-selection). The gap sets nest: $\mathrm{gap}(E_6) \subset \mathrm{gap}(E_7) \subset \mathrm{gap}(E_8)$ and $\mathrm{gap}(D_8) \subset \mathrm{gap}(E_8)$, so $E_8$ is the unique maximal element under gap-set inclusion. Domain wall tensions between branches are finite (bounded by $\max(h_1, h_2)$), with $E_8$ walls the most expensive by a factor of $\sim$456×. Thermal stability analysis shows $E_8$ walls dissolve last during cosmological cooling, and zero-temperature bounce actions satisfy $B \gg 1$ for all downhill transitions—tunneling between branches is frozen out. Selection occurs during the compactification epoch and is irreversible.
