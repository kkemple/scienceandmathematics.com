  This paper presents a geometric framework combining Constraint Eigenvalue Theory (CET) with EVL (Eigenvalue-Limited) geometry to explain structural organization across physical systems from quantum transport to cosmological scales. The theory proposes that coherent systems are governed by three incompatible curvature operators—angular, recursive, and discrete—whose competitive dynamics determine observable organization patterns.

  The framework introduces a constraint-dissipation fraction η(z) that evolves according to a β-flow with golden-ratio invariants, predicting specific thresholds for system reorganization. EVL geometry provides microscopic foundations through Penrose tiling spectral analysis, revealing that approximately 67% of spectral weight localizes on 5% geometric support in defect regions.

  Key predictions include: structural transitions near η ≈ 0.329 (partial sector saturation), maintenance bankruptcy near η_c ≈ 0.304, and tri-sector saturation in black holes explaining their unique boundary-only dynamics. The framework successfully accounts for galactic bar formation, cosmological matter-Λ partitioning, and provides observational predictions for CMB y-distortions and modified structure growth.

  Unlike phenomenological models, CET×EVL derives macroscopic behavior from geometric constraints on information flow, making falsifiable predictions about when and how complex systems reorganize under increasing constraint pressure.

What if galaxies, white dwarf stars, and the large-scale universe all reorganize according to the same geometric principle? Not because they share similar physics, but because they encounter the same fundamental constraint: three incompatible ways of organizing curvature that cannot be optimized simultaneously.

Recent work combining Constraint Eigenvalue Theory (CET) with EVL (Eigenvalue-Limited) geometry suggests exactly this. The framework reveals how triadic competition among curvature sectors creates predictable thresholds where complex systems abruptly switch structural modes—explaining everything from galactic bar formation to cosmological expansion dominance with the same mathematical backbone.

## Three Ways to Bend Space

Every coherent physical system faces the same organizational challenge: how to distribute curvature. CET identifies three fundamental approaches, each incompatible with the others.

The **angular sector** (π-operator) minimizes directional curvature through isotropic distribution. Think of a soap bubble achieving perfect spherical symmetry by equalizing surface tension in all directions. This sector favors smooth, symmetric configurations that spread curvature as uniformly as possible.

The **recursive sector** (β-operator) organizes curvature through hierarchical, self-similar patterns. Like rivers branching into tributaries or lightning creating fractal discharge patterns, this sector builds efficient transport networks by concentrating flow along preferred pathways while maintaining accessibility across scales.

The **discrete sector** (N-operator) packages curvature into quantized, locally stable units. Crystal structures exemplify this approach—discrete lattice sites with specific coordination numbers that maintain structural integrity through geometric constraints rather than continuous optimization.

The mathematical insight is that these three approaches cannot be simultaneously optimized. Attempting to make a system perfectly isotropic destroys hierarchical structure. Building efficient transport networks breaks isotropy. Enforcing discrete packaging disrupts both smooth distributions and hierarchical flows.

This creates triadic competition. Real systems must choose which sector to prioritize, which to constrain, and how to manage the resulting tensions. The choice determines the system's macroscopic organization.

## The Golden Ratio Emerges

CET quantifies this competition through a dimensionless parameter measuring the fraction of total energy devoted to maintaining coherence against curvature pressure:

$$
\eta = \frac{E_{\text{maintenance}}}{E_{\text{total}}}.
$$

The theory's central prediction is that this parameter evolves according to a β-flow with a universal coupling constant:

$$
\rho^* = \frac{4\pi\varphi^2}{10} \approx 3.29,
$$

where $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio. This value emerges from requiring consistent triadic competition across the three curvature sectors—the only mathematical structure that permits stable competition without immediate collapse to a two-sector or single-sector solution.

The golden ratio appears because triadic systems require a coupling that cannot be expressed as a ratio of small integers. Simple rational couplings create resonances that either eliminate one sector or cause the system to oscillate unstably between configurations. The golden ratio, being the "most irrational" number with continued fraction representation $[1;1,1,1,...]$, provides the optimal balance for sustained three-way competition.

## Predictable Thresholds

The β-flow structure creates two critical thresholds that appear across domains.

**Sector saturation** occurs near $\eta \approx \rho^*/10 \approx 0.329$. At this point, one curvature sector reaches its organizational limit while the others retain slack capacity. The system responds by switching to a new structural eigenmode that reduces load on the saturated sector while increasing curvature in the remaining sectors.

Disk galaxies demonstrate this mechanism clearly. Spiral galaxies maintain distributed angular momentum transport through trailing spiral density waves—a configuration that balances all three curvature sectors. As gas accretion and stellar feedback increase the discrete (N-sector) organization costs, the system approaches the saturation threshold. Once crossed, the galaxy abruptly transitions to a bar configuration that relieves discrete curvature by concentrating mass transport into a rigid rotating structure.

The transition happens sharply because eigenmode switching is a discrete geometric operation, not a gradual parameter adjustment. Observational surveys confirm that barred fractions jump discontinuously in galaxy samples, with the transition clustering near the predicted threshold.

**Maintenance bankruptcy** occurs at $\eta_c = 1/\rho^* \approx 0.304$. This represents true systemic failure where no remaining sector can absorb additional curvature. Unlike sector saturation, bankruptcy leads to collapse rather than reorganization.

White dwarf stars exemplify this regime. As accretion increases stellar mass toward the Chandrasekhar limit, the maintenance cost of sustaining electron degeneracy pressure against gravitational compression grows rapidly. The system cannot switch to alternative structural modes—electron degeneracy is already the minimal-energy configuration for the given mass and composition. When maintenance costs reach bankruptcy, the star collapses catastrophically to a neutron star, releasing energy through Type Ia supernova explosion.

## EVL Geometry Provides Microscopic Structure

While CET explains macroscopic competition, it requires microscopic foundations to determine specific coupling values and geometric constraints. This is where EVL geometry enters.

EVL theory analyzes spectral localization on quasicrystalline supports, particularly rhombic Penrose tilings. These structures exhibit remarkable efficiency: approximately 67% of spectral weight concentrates on just 5% of geometric sites—specifically, the high-coordination defect vertices where local pentagonal symmetry is broken.

This spectral concentration creates **coherence leverage**. A small geometric support carries most of the system's dynamical weight, enabling efficient control and organization. The mechanism resembles how a small number of highly connected nodes in a network can control information flow across the entire system, but here the concentration emerges from geometric constraints rather than network topology.

The key EVL constants derived from rigorous spectral analysis are:
- Defect fraction: $f_{\rm def} = \tau^{-6} \approx 0.056$
- Spectral localization: $\chi_{\rm hot} \approx 0.677$
- Coherence efficiency: $\epsilon_{\rm micro} = \chi_{\rm hot}/f_{\rm def} \approx 12.15$

These numbers become fixed microscopic constants in cosmological applications, replacing phenomenological parameters with values derived from geometric principles.

## Black Holes as Tri-Sector Exhaustion

Most systems experiencing constraint pressure reorganize by switching eigenmodes—they avoid collapse by finding new ways to distribute curvature. Black holes represent the exceptional case where **all three curvature sectors saturate simultaneously**.

At the event horizon, the angular sector saturates as directional degrees of freedom pack at maximum isotropic density. The recursive sector saturates as radial information flow freezes, enforcing dimensional reduction to surface encoding. The discrete sector saturates as information storage reaches the Bekenstein-Hawking bound with no remaining capacity for local reorganization.

With no sector available to absorb additional curvature, redistribution becomes impossible. The system collapses onto a boundary-only configuration where interior degrees of freedom disappear entirely. This explains why black holes exhibit horizon dominance, no-hair behavior, and exact entropy scaling—they are terminal states of tri-sector exhaustion rather than merely collapsed objects.

The mathematical structure supporting this analysis appears in the formal lemma: tri-sector saturation eliminates redistribution degrees of freedom, forcing boundary-only dynamics with rigidity rather than continued eigenmode switching. Black holes thus represent the unique physical regime where CET predicts terminal behavior instead of reorganization.

## Cosmological Implementation

The CET×EVL framework produces a complete cosmological sector with testable predictions. The constraint-dissipation fraction follows a specific β-flow:

$$
\frac{d\eta}{dx} = -\eta(1-\eta)\left[\rho^* + \frac{d_{\rm eff}(\eta)-2}{2}\ln\tau \right],
$$

where $x = \ln\left(\frac{1+z}{1+z_c}\right)$ and the effective dimension ansatz $d_{\rm eff}(\eta) = 3 - \eta$ captures the systematic dimensional reduction as constraint pressure increases.

This evolution creates a maintenance rate field:

$$
r(z) = \frac{B_0}{\epsilon_{\rm micro}} H(z) K(\eta(z))\eta(z)(1-\eta(z)),
$$

where $H(z)$ is the Hubble parameter and $B_0 \approx 0.416$ is a closure constant determined by requiring consistency at the bankruptcy threshold.

The framework interprets this rate through Landauer's principle: at horizon scale, the temperature is $T_H \propto H(z)$ and information density scales with $H(z)$, creating an information power density $P_{\rm info}(z) = r(z) u_{\rm crit}(z)$ where $u_{\rm crit}$ is the critical energy density.

## Observational Consequences

The theory makes several testable predictions that distinguish it from standard cosmological models.

**CMB y-distortion constraint.** The information power couples to baryon temperature through Compton scattering, creating a y-distortion:

$$
y = \frac{1}{4}\int\frac{P_{\rm heat}(z)}{u_\gamma(z)} dt,
$$

where $P_{\rm heat} = f_{\rm dep}(z) P_{\rm info}(z)$ and $f_{\rm dep}$ is the thermal coupling efficiency.

Under the closed-loop assumption where $\epsilon = \epsilon_{\rm micro}$ and spectral localization follows EVL geometry, the predicted y-distortion is $y_{\rm pred} \approx 5.5 \times 10^{-6}$, compared to the observational bound $y_{\max} = 5.2 \times 10^{-6}$. The framework predicts values within 6% of the observational limit—not as a fitted parameter, but as a consequence of geometric constants derived from Penrose tiling analysis.

This near-saturation of the y-bound suggests that at most 94% of defect-layer maintenance power couples thermally to electrons, with the remaining 6% necessarily dark or non-Compton-visible. This provides a structural constraint on hidden sector physics rather than an arbitrary parameter.

**Modified structure growth.** Instead of adding diffusion terms that catastrophically erase structure, CET introduces scale-restricted friction:

$$
\delta'' + \left[2 + \frac{d\ln H}{d\ln a} + \Gamma_{\rm CET}(a,k)\right]\delta' + \frac{3}{2}\Omega_m(a)\delta = 0,
$$

where $\Gamma_{\rm CET}$ includes a coherence scale $k_{\rm coh}(z) = 2\pi H(z)/(\beta c)$ that suppresses effects on small scales while allowing large-scale modifications.

Numerical integrations show that for natural parameter choices, deviations from standard growth remain below 1% at redshifts where observational data exists, while permitting larger effects at $z > 10$ and on superhorizon scales. This preserves compatibility with current structure formation constraints while allowing CET effects to address large-scale anomalies like CMB dipole-quadrupole alignment and hemispherical power asymmetry.

## Falsifiability and Scope

CET×EVL makes structural claims about what kinds of dynamics are possible rather than fitting parameters to reproduce known results. The framework is falsifiable at multiple independent levels.

If high-quality datasets show no clustering or discontinuity near the predicted saturation thresholds after controlling for known physics, the sector-saturation interpretation fails. If systems with demonstrably non-integrable constraint projections exhibit sustained convergence without cycling, the curl diagnostic fails. If independent spectral analyses on alternative quasicrystalline supports fail to reproduce stable localization fractions, the EVL micro-foundation lacks universality.

The framework does not claim to derive detailed microphysics, replace domain-specific equations, or predict exact numerical ratios without variance. It predicts structural patterns in how complex systems reorganize under increasing constraint pressure.

## Implications

The CET×EVL framework suggests that phenomena across scales—from quantum coherence transitions to galactic morphological changes to cosmological expansion phases—reflect the same underlying geometric principle: triadic competition among incompatible curvature sectors under feasibility projection.

This connects microscopic quantum information principles to macroscopic gravitational phenomena through constraint geometry rather than through postulated force relations or dimensional analysis. The mathematics flows from demanding consistency between quantum mechanics, general relativity, and thermodynamics at interfaces where information processing meets curvature constraints.

The practical consequence is a cosmological model where large-scale structure formation, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background statistics emerge from the same geometric backbone that governs quantum transport optimization and biological metabolic efficiency. Different domains exhibit different saturation orders and mappings, but the underlying triadic competition structure appears across scales.

Whether this represents fundamental physical organization or mathematical coincidence requires empirical test through the framework's specific predictions about spectral correlations, growth modifications, and saturation clustering across domains where constraint pressure approaches geometric limits.
