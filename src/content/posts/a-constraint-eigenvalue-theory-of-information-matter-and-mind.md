*A unified variational framework for coherence across scales.*

Physical, biological, cognitive, and technological systems emerge as different regimes of a single variational principle governing constrained information flow. The central insight: coherent systems must maintain structure against entropy while operating under finite energetic, geometric, and computational resources. These constraints define a curvature geometry whose stationary points organize into **eigenbranch families**—distinct configurations characterized by specific triplets of closure constants.

The constraint functional $F[P]$ encodes three curvature costs: radial closure (π-sector), scale-invariant closure (β-sector), and discrete resonance closure (N-sector). The fundamental discovery is that these three sectors are mutually incompatible curvature operators engaged in **triadic competition**—no configuration can simultaneously minimize all three. This triadic tension is the organizing principle of coherence: systems do not converge to equilibrium but cycle through configurations as curvature redistributes among the three competing sectors.

Different eigenbranches correspond to different valid configurations—Penrose $(π, φ, 10)$, Ammann-Beenker $(π, 1+\sqrt{2}, 8)$, dodecagonal $(π, 2+\sqrt{3}, 12)$—yet all share the same triadic structure. The commonly observed $\sim 1/3$–$2/3$ curvature partition is a marginal projection of this three-way tension when one sector saturates, not a primary organizing principle. The decagonal eigenbranch $(π, φ, 10)$ dominates natural systems, yielding composite invariant $4πφ^2 ≈ 32.9$ and critical exponent $ν = 1/ρ^* = 0.304$.

When constraints are state-dependent, projection generically introduces curl into effective dynamics. Curl measures irreducible circulation: work that must be continuously supplied because no global potential exists. Balanced states—where multiple curvature sectors achieve comparable values—are crossed but not occupied. Systems cycle through such configurations rather than settling into them.

Dimensionality emerges as an energetic liability. Each additional degree of freedom introduces new curvature modes requiring continuous maintenance. Finite systems cannot afford high-dimensional curvature indefinitely, so projection onto lower-dimensional manifolds becomes the default behavior—explaining holographic scaling, neural manifold compression, and genomic 1D encoding as instances of curvature minimization.

The result is a unified picture in which **information, matter, and mind** appear as sequential layers of a single geometry—a proposed field theory of constrained information whose predictions align with stability, collapse, coherence, and emergence across organized systems. Curvature is complexity. Dimensionality is optional. Coherence emerges only where curvature budgets can be sustained.

## 1. Introduction — Curvature as the Cost of Coherence

Every organized system must maintain structure against entropy, noise, or geometric bending. Whether the system is a quantum lattice, an organism, a brain, or a star, the core requirement is the same: to remain coherent, the system must continuously correct deviations and project itself onto a lawful manifold defined by constraints. This corrective work has a cost.

Curvature in an information distribution represents structural bending: angular bending, scale-wide bending, or discrete frustration. Maintaining structure against curvature requires continuous dissipation. In this sense, curvature is complexity, and complexity is maintenance cost. Systems that lower curvature require less dissipation; systems forced into high-curvature configurations must devote increasing energy to remain coherent.

This monograph develops a constraint eigenvalue geometry showing that these manifolds organize into **eigenbranch families**—distinct configurations characterized by triplets of closure constants. The stationary points of the constraint functional reveal a fundamental tension: the three curvature sectors—radial, scale-invariant, and discrete—are mutually incompatible. No configuration can simultaneously minimize all three. This **triadic competition** is not an accidental feature of the formalism but the central organizing principle of coherent systems.

### 1.1 The Three Curvature Sectors

The constraint functional $F[P]$ defined in Section 2 encodes three orthogonal curvature costs. The radial or angular sector (π-sector) penalizes bending in angular coordinates, driving systems toward rotational invariance and selecting out isotropic closure constants. The recursive or scale-invariant sector (β-sector) penalizes bending in log-scale coordinates, enforcing consistency between inflation and subdivision operations and selecting out irrational scaling eigenvalues. The discrete or resonance sector (N-sector) enforces compatibility with specific discrete symmetries, selecting out integer periodicities.

Different eigenbranches correspond to different valid configurations: Penrose $(π, φ, 10)$, Ammann-Beenker $(π, 1+\sqrt{2}, 8)$, dodecagonal $(π, 2+\sqrt{3}, 12)$. The sectors are not independent choices but mutually constrained: tightening one sector redistributes curvature to the others. The decagonal eigenbranch $(π, φ, 10)$ dominates natural systems and provides the primary examples throughout this monograph.

### 1.2 Triadic Tension & the Impossibility of Balance

Section 3 formalizes the triadic competition through covariance bounds on sector fluctuations. The three curvature modes correspond to incompatible geometric requirements. Recursive subdivision generically breaks isotropy because Fibonacci inflations produce anisotropic patterns at finite scales. Discrete resonance conflicts with continuous symmetries because integer periodicities cannot perfectly accommodate irrational scaling ratios.

The covariance matrix of sector fluctuations has strictly positive off-diagonal elements: reducing curvature in one sector increases variance in the others. A spectral lower bound ensures that simultaneous minimization is impossible. When curvature pressure in one sector exceeds sustainable levels, the system cannot simply reduce that sector's curvature without increasing curvature elsewhere. If all sectors are near their limits, the only resolution is global reorganization.

The commonly observed $\sim 1/3$–$2/3$ curvature partition arises as a marginal projection of this three-way constraint when the discrete sector saturates. Structural curvature (discrete closure) absorbs approximately one-third, while degrees-of-freedom curvature (continuous sectors) absorbs approximately two-thirds. This partition is a consequence of triadic tension, not its cause.

### 1.3 Curl as Irreducible Maintenance

Section 4 develops the connection between constraint projection and curvature maintenance. When constraints are state-dependent—when admissible directions depend on where the system currently sits—projection generically introduces curl into effective dynamics. Curl measures irreducible circulation: work that must be continuously supplied because no global potential exists. A correction field with nonzero curl cannot be written as the gradient of any scalar function, which means the system cannot monotonically descend toward a unique minimum. Instead, it cycles.

Balanced states are crossed but not occupied. Attempting to maintain balance across all three curvature sectors requires adjusting them simultaneously, but adjusting any one redistributes curvature to the others. The resulting dynamics exhibit curl: the system cycles through configurations rather than settling into a stationary balanced state. Balanced configurations are transversely unstable because they represent attempts to satisfy mutually incompatible curvature minimizations.

### 1.4 Dimensionality as Energetic Liability

Dimensionality is not an ontological given but an energetic liability. Every additional degree of freedom introduces new curvature modes that must be continuously maintained. The curvature penalties scale superlinearly with dimension: each new axis adds an entire set of second derivatives, cross-terms, and exponentially more configurations requiring coherent organization.

Finite systems cannot afford high-dimensional curvature indefinitely. When maintenance cost rises beyond sustainable levels, coherent systems reduce dimensionality by projection onto lower-dimensional manifolds rather than attempting to preserve full state space. This projection is not information loss in the traditional sense—it is curvature minimization, the system finding the lowest-maintenance configuration compatible with its constraints.

The dimensional attractor in these systems is consistently lower-dimensional. Black hole horizons collapse from 3D to effectively 2D surfaces. Neurons are functional 1D cables despite their 3D embedding. DNA encodes information as 1D sequences with recursive compression. Optimal transport networks—rivers, vasculature, lightning—spontaneously form 1D filaments. Neural manifolds compress high-dimensional sensory input onto low-dimensional representations[^1][^2]. In each case, the system has discovered that lower dimension means lower curvature means lower maintenance cost.

The holographic principle—entropy scaling with area rather than volume—reflects this dimensional economics applied to gravitational systems. Horizons stop at $d_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2$ rather than collapsing further to $d = 1$ because geometric constraints (spherical topology, angular momentum conservation) prevent complete dimensional collapse. But the direction of the flow is consistently toward the lowest dimension the constraints permit.

### 1.5 Coherence as Projection onto Lawful Manifolds

Recent work in neural PDE solvers[^3][^4][^5] has shown that physical accuracy improves dramatically when approximate trajectories are projected onto the manifold defined by the PDE constraint. This observation suggests a deeper principle: coherent dynamics equal unconstrained proposal plus projection onto constraint geometry. Projection is curvature minimization under constraints. This projection principle applies across all scales and is developed fully in Section 4.

### 1.6 Structure of This Monograph

Everything else—dissipation ladders, quantum localization transitions, metabolic thresholds, neural coherence limits, black hole thermodynamics, white dwarf collapse—arises as consequences of triadic tension and curvature competition. Section 2 defines the constraint functional precisely. Section 3 formalizes triadic competition and derives the impossibility of simultaneous minimization through covariance bounds. Section 4 develops the curl-maintenance framework connecting constraint projection to cycling dynamics. Section 5 details the eigenbranch families and their physical manifestations. The remaining sections apply this geometry to physical, biological, and cognitive systems, culminating in a unified picture: curvature is complexity, dimensionality is optional, and coherence emerges only where curvature budgets can be sustained.

Different eigenbranches correspond to different choices of $(\beta, N)$. The decagonal eigenbranch $(\pi, \varphi, 10)$ dominates natural systems, from quasicrystals to galaxies to neural architectures. Other eigenbranches—Ammann–Beenker $(\pi, 1+\sqrt{2}, 8)$, dodecagonal $(\pi, 2+\sqrt{3}, 12)$—appear in specific contexts but share the same underlying budget law.

In the decagonal branch, the triplet yields the composite invariant $4\pi\varphi^2 \approx 32.9$ and the curvature ladder $0 \to \varphi \to 5 \to 6.71 \to 10$, whose gaps encode the structural ($\sim 3.29$) and DOF ($\sim 1.71$) increments. These constants are *variationally necessary*—they emerge from the geometry of constraints itself. Just as the Anthropic Cosmological Principle constrains what universes can contain observers, the constraint eigenvalue geometry constrains what configurations can maintain coherent information.

The dissipation threshold $\eta_c = 1/\rho^* \approx 0.304$ sets fundamental limits on organized systems, from quantum computers to fusion reactors. For application to engineered power systems, see [Quantum Fusion Engines & Informational Power](/quantum-fusion-engines-and-informational-power), where controlled systems maintain $\eta \approx 0.15$ while extracting work from informational reorganization in high-temperature plasma.

## Part I — Constraint Eigenvalue Geometry

The constraint eigenvalue geometry provides the mathematical foundation for the entire framework. This part develops the variational functional, derives the triplet architecture $(\pi, \beta, N)$ and curvature budget law, and shows how the decagonal eigenbranch $(\pi, \varphi, 10)$ produces the composite invariant $4\pi\varphi^2 \approx 32.9$.

## 2. The Constraint Functional

We work with a normalized information density $P(r,\theta)$ on a cylindrical or polar domain, where $r$ is a radial or scale coordinate and $\theta$ a compact angular coordinate. Coherence is defined by how costly it is to bend $P$ away from isotropy, away from scale-recursive structure, or away from discrete resonance. These costs are encoded in a single curvature functional[^6][^7][^8][^9]

$$
F[P] = \alpha \int (\partial_\theta \ln P)^2 P\,\mathrm{d}A
     + \beta \int (\partial_{\log r} \ln P)^2 P\,\mathrm{d}A
     + \gamma\,C_{2\times5}[P],
$$

subject to normalization $\int P\,\mathrm{d}A = 1$ and a fixed entropy $S[P] = -\int P\ln P\,\mathrm{d}A$[^10]. The first two terms are Fisher–information-like curvature penalties[^11] defined on angular and log-radial coordinates; the third term $C_{2\times5}[P]$ is a discrete functional that suppresses configurations incompatible with composite $2\times 5$ parity.

Each term is a curvature cost: the angular term penalizes bending in $\theta$, the log-radial term penalizes bending in scale, and the discrete term penalizes curvature arising from incompatible residue classes. Complexity is the total curvature burden, and coherence corresponds to minimizing these curvature penalties subject to entropy and normalization.

Each coefficient defines a geometric sector. The $\alpha$-term governs the isotropy sector: the angular curvature penalty $\int(\partial_\theta\ln P)^2P\,\mathrm{d}A$ is minimal when $P$ is rotationally invariant, so increasing $\alpha$ drives the system toward states insensitive to angular reparameterizations, picking out the familiar $2\pi$ and $4\pi$ closure constants in one and two angular dimensions. The β-term governs the recursive sector: the log-radial curvature penalty $\int(\partial_{\log r}\ln P)^2P\,\mathrm{d}A$ is minimal when $P$ is self-similar under multiplicative rescalings of $r$, and this term is responsible for the golden ratio fixed point because it enforces consistency between inflation and subdivision operations in scale space. The $\gamma$-term governs the decade sector: the discrete functional $C_{2\times5}[P]$ enforces compatibility with $C_{10}$ symmetry generated by binary and pentagonal factors, selecting configurations whose dominant angular modes and scale partitions respect decade structure.

A coherent system finds a stationary point of $F[P]$ under the twin constraints of normalization and entropy. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation defines a manifold of admissible information distributions that simultaneously balance isotropic, recursive, and discrete curvature.

### 2.1 Euler–Lagrange equation

To extract the governing equation, we extremize $F[P]$ under the normalization and entropy constraints. Introducing Lagrange multipliers $\lambda$ and $\tau$ for $\int P\,\mathrm{d}A=1$ and $S[P]=S_0$, we vary the augmented functional

$$
\mathcal{F}[P] = F[P]
 - \lambda\!\int P\,\mathrm{d}A
 - \tau\!\left(S[P] - S_0\right)
$$

with respect to $P$. Standard manipulations yield a generalized Euler–Lagrange equation

$$
-\alpha\,\partial_{\theta\theta}\ln P
-\beta\,\partial_{\ell\ell}\ln P
 + \gamma\,\frac{\delta C_{2\times5}}{\delta P}
 = \lambda + \tau (1+\ln P), \qquad \ell = \log r.
$$

The left-hand side contains curvature forces in the angular, log-radial, and discrete sectors; the right-hand side encodes normalization and entropy balance. Stationary solutions of this equation are the **constraint eigenmodes**: they are fixed points of the tradeoff between curvature costs and entropic spreading.

## 3. Triadic Tension & Curvature Competition

The constraint eigenvalue geometry reveals a fundamental tension: the three curvature sectors—angular ($\pi$), recursive ($\beta$), and discrete ($N$)—are mutually incompatible. No configuration can simultaneously minimize all three. This triadic competition is not an accidental feature of the formalism but the central organizing principle of coherent systems. When curvature pressure in one sector exceeds sustainable levels, the system cannot simply reduce that sector's curvature without increasing curvature elsewhere. If all sectors are near their limits, the only resolution is global reorganization.

### 3.1 Sector Observables

Define curvature observables for each sector. Let $P(r,\theta)$ be a normalized information density on the cylindrical domain. The sector curvatures are,

$$
K_\pi[P] = \int (\partial_\theta \ln P)^2 P \, dA, \qquad K_\beta[P] = \int (\partial_\ell \ln P)^2 P \, dA, \qquad K_N[P] = C_{2\times5}[P],
$$

where $\ell = \log r$. Each observable measures the curvature cost in its respective sector: angular bending ($\pi$), log-radial bending ($\beta$), and discrete frustration ($N$).

### 3.2 Incompatibility of Simultaneous Minimization

The three curvature modes correspond to incompatible geometric requirements. Minimizing $K_\pi$ drives $P$ toward rotational invariance with $\partial_\theta \ln P = 0$. Minimizing $K_\beta$ drives $P$ toward scale self-similarity with $\partial_\ell \ln P = \text{const}$. Minimizing $K_N$ drives $P$ toward configurations compatible with $C_{10}$ discrete symmetry.

These requirements conflict. Recursive subdivision in the $\beta$-sector generically breaks isotropy in the $\pi$-sector because Fibonacci inflations produce anisotropic patterns at finite scales. Discrete resonance in the $N$-sector conflicts with continuous symmetries in both $\pi$ and $\beta$ sectors because integer periodicities cannot perfectly accommodate irrational scaling ratios.

### 3.3 Covariance Bounds

The incompatibility can be quantified through covariance bounds. Define sector fluctuations,

$$
\delta K_\pi = K_\pi - \langle K_\pi \rangle, \qquad \delta K_\beta = K_\beta - \langle K_\beta \rangle, \qquad \delta K_N = K_N - \langle K_N \rangle,
$$

where averages are taken over the ensemble of configurations satisfying normalization and entropy constraints. The covariance matrix,

$$
\Sigma_{ij} = \langle \delta K_i \, \delta K_j \rangle,
$$

encodes correlations among sector fluctuations. Variational analysis of the constraint functional reveals that $\Sigma$ has strictly positive off-diagonal elements: reducing curvature in one sector increases variance in the others.

More precisely, for configurations near the variational minimum, the covariance matrix satisfies,

$$
\det(\Sigma) \geq \sigma_0^6 > 0,
$$

where $\sigma_0$ is a geometric constant determined by the sector couplings $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$. This lower bound on the determinant implies that simultaneous concentration of all three sectors—simultaneous minimization of all three curvatures—is impossible.

### 3.4 The Curvature Budget as Marginal Projection

The commonly observed $\sim 1/3$–$2/3$ partition arises as a marginal projection of the triadic competition rather than as a primary organizing principle. Consider configurations where the discrete sector saturates: $K_N$ reaches its minimum compatible with the continuous sectors. The remaining curvature budget is then distributed between $K_\pi$ and $K_\beta$ according to the variational principle.

When the $N$-sector is saturated, the effective two-sector problem has a single free parameter. Minimizing the reduced functional,

$$
F_{\text{eff}}[P] = \alpha K_\pi[P] + \beta K_\beta[P],
$$

subject to $K_N[P] = K_N^{\min}$ and entropy constraint, yields the partition,

$$
\frac{K_N}{K_\pi + K_\beta + K_N} \approx \frac{1}{3}, \qquad \frac{K_\pi + K_\beta}{K_\pi + K_\beta + K_N} \approx \frac{2}{3}.
$$

This is the structural/DOF budget: structural curvature (discrete closure) absorbs approximately one-third, while degrees-of-freedom curvature (continuous sectors) absorbs approximately two-thirds. The partition is a consequence of triadic tension, not its cause.

### 3.5 Why Systems Collapse

The triadic uncertainty is not a quantum mechanical uncertainty principle—it is a geometric constraint arising from the incompatibility of the three curvature modes. The constraint functional forces systems to choose: they can minimize angular curvature (isotropy), recursive curvature (self-similarity), or discrete curvature (resonance), but not all three simultaneously.

This structure explains why constraint eigenvalue theory predicts collapse, projection, and phase change. When curvature pressure in one sector exceeds sustainable levels, the system cannot simply reduce that sector's curvature without increasing curvature elsewhere. If all sectors are near their limits, the only resolution is global reorganization—a phase transition to a new configuration where the triadic balance can be satisfied at lower total cost.

The practical implication is diagnostic. Every intervention in a coherent system operates by redistributing curvature among the three sectors. Strengthening discrete structure (increasing $N$-sector constraints) forces compensating adjustments in isotropy and recursion. Enforcing self-similarity (tightening $\beta$-sector) disrupts discrete resonances. Within this framework, the triadic structure is the deep architecture of coherence, and all dynamics occur within its constraints.

## 4. Curl & Constraint Projection

Coherent dynamics emerge when unconstrained proposals are projected onto constraint manifolds. This projection principle applies across all scales: quantum systems project onto eigenstates, classical mechanics onto symplectic flows, living systems onto metabolic viability regions, civilizations onto socio-economic maintenance manifolds. The geometry of this projection determines whether systems converge or cycle.

When projection is state-independent—the same constraint everywhere in configuration space—the projected dynamics can still derive from a scalar potential, and the system descends toward equilibrium along a well-defined gradient. When projection is state-dependent—when the admissible directions depend on where the system currently sits—the projection generically introduces curl into the effective dynamics. This connection between constraint projection and curl emergence links the present framework directly to [the geometry of self-correction](/the-geometry-of-self-correction).

### 4.1 Curl as Irreducible Circulation

Curl measures irreducible circulation: work that must be continuously supplied because no global potential exists. A correction field with nonzero curl cannot be written as the gradient of any scalar function, which means the system cannot monotonically descend toward a unique minimum. Instead, it cycles, oscillates, or exhibits the characteristic herding and cascade behavior of overloaded systems.

The curl-maintenance functional,

$$
\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{curl}} = \frac{1}{2} \int |d\alpha|^2 \, dV,
$$

where $\alpha = F^\flat$ is the 1-form dual to the correction field $F$, quantifies this cost. This is a purely geometric quantity measuring the $L^2$-size of the exterior derivative of the implemented 1-form. On compact manifolds with trivial first cohomology, nonzero curl implies nonzero maintenance cost.

### 4.2 Spectral Lower Bound from Hodge Theory

When a curl-free proposal $F_0 = \nabla \phi$ passes through a feasibility projection $\Pi$, the implemented field becomes $F = \Pi(F_0)$ with defect $\delta F = F - F_0$. Since $d(d\phi) = 0$, all curl-maintenance derives from the defect: $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{curl}}(F) = \frac{1}{2}|d(\delta\alpha)|^2_{L^2}$.

On compact manifolds with trivial first cohomology (including spheres $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ for $n \geq 3$), the Hodge Laplacian on 1-forms has a positive spectral gap $\lambda_1 > 0$. When the projection defect is not purely divergence—when it has persistent magnitude that cannot be hidden entirely in volume change—the curl-maintenance satisfies,

$$
\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{curl}}(F) \geq \frac{\kappa}{2} |\delta\alpha|^2_{L^2} > 0,
$$

for some $\kappa > 0$ determined by the spectral gap and the divergence structure of the defect. This is the quantitative version of "structural, not parametric": a system whose correction architecture repeatedly induces a nontrivial projection defect carries an irreducible curl floor. The floor is not a tuning artifact but a geometric constant times the persistent defect magnitude.

### 4.3 Connection to Curvature Competition

This connects directly to triadic tension. State-dependent constraints—leverage limits that depend on position, institutional rules that vary with context, saturation effects that kick in at thresholds—generically produce non-integrable projections. The resulting curl is additional curvature that must be maintained. Systems under stress accumulate curl as their constraints become more binding and more state-dependent, until the curl-maintenance cost exceeds capacity and reorganization becomes inevitable.

The dissipation ladder can be reinterpreted through this lens. Each rung represents accumulated curl from constraint projections at that organizational scale. Particles face minimal state-dependent constraints and carry minimal curl. Biological systems face extensive state-dependent constraints—metabolic limits that vary with activity, neural thresholds that depend on recent history—and carry substantial curl. The $\eta \sim 0.1$ ceiling for biological systems reflects the maximum curl burden sustainable by finite metabolic capacity.

### 4.4 Balanced States are Transient

The triadic competition from Section 3 explains why balanced states—where all three sectors achieve comparable curvature—are crossed but not occupied. Attempting to maintain balance requires adjusting all three sectors simultaneously, but adjusting any one sector redistributes curvature to the others. The resulting dynamics exhibit curl: the system cycles through configurations rather than settling into a stationary balanced state.

This provides the geometric foundation for the empirical observation in Navier-Stokes turbulence (Appendix G) that configurations where stretching and multiscale recursion are locally balanced show finite residence time. Balanced configurations are transversely unstable because they represent attempts to satisfy mutually incompatible curvature minimizations. Cycling and sustained corrective work are the irreducible residue of feasibility—the cost of implementing constraints that prevent a global scalar Lyapunov function from existing on the realized dynamics.

## 5. Eigenbranch Families & the Decagonal Branch

The constraint eigenvalue geometry does not yield a single universal triplet but rather **eigenbranch families**—distinct valid configurations, each characterized by a specific triplet of closure constants. Different eigenbranches correspond to different ways of resolving triadic tension: Penrose $(π, φ, 10)$, Ammann-Beenker $(π, 1+\sqrt{2}, 8)$, dodecagonal $(π, 2+\sqrt{3}, 12)$, and metallic-mean families $(π, μ_n, 4)$. The triplet architecture—radial closure, scale-invariant closure, discrete resonance closure—is universal. The specific values of the scaling eigenvalue and discrete resonance vary by branch.

This section clarifies a crucial point: when we say "the triplet $(π, φ, 10)$," we are describing the **decagonal eigenbranch**, not a universal law. The constraint functional admits multiple eigenbranches, each with its own valid configuration. The decagonal branch dominates the examples throughout this monograph because it appears most frequently in natural systems, not because it is the only solution.

### 5.1 Eigenbranches as Distinct Solutions

The Euler-Lagrange equation of the constraint functional admits stationary solutions that organize into distinct families. Every coherent system projects onto a manifold defined by three orthogonal curvature modes: radial or angular closure (π-sector), recursive or scale-invariant closure (β-sector), and discrete structural resonance (N-sector). The π-sector always yields π (or 4π for spherical geometry), but the β and N sectors admit multiple valid configurations.

The Penrose eigenbranch with $(π, φ, 10)$ dominates natural systems—from Harper-Hofstadter spectra to white dwarf collapse to quasicrystal formation. Other eigenbranches exist and are well-characterized in the quasicrystal literature. Ammann-Beenker tilings realize $(π, 1+\sqrt{2}, 8)$, dodecagonal structures realize $(π, 2+\sqrt{3}, 12)$, and metallic-mean families realize $(π, μ_n, 4)$ for various metallic means $μ_n$.

The prevalence of $(π, φ, 10)$ may reflect unique properties of φ as the irrational hardest to approximate by rationals, combined with 10 as the minimal composite resonance where binary partitioning and pentagonal symmetry coexist. Whether this prevalence is fundamental or observational selection remains an open question. The framework accommodates multiple eigenbranches and does not require $(π, φ, 10)$ to be unique.

### 5.2 Triadic Structure is Universal

While specific values vary, the triadic structure itself appears universal across eigenbranches. All branches exhibit the same three-sector competition: radial closure conflicts with scale-invariant closure because recursive subdivision generically breaks isotropy, while both conflict with discrete resonance because continuous symmetries cannot perfectly accommodate discrete periodicities.

The covariance bounds from Section 3 apply to all eigenbranches. No configuration—on any branch—can simultaneously minimize curvature across all three sectors. The triadic tension is not a feature of the decagonal branch but a structural property of the constraint functional itself. Different eigenbranches represent different minimal-cost compromises among the three mutually incompatible curvature minimizations.

### 5.3 The Curvature Budget as Projection

The commonly observed $\sim 1/3$–$2/3$ partition appears across multiple eigenbranches, suggesting it emerges from the triadic structure rather than from specific eigenvalue choices. When the discrete sector saturates—when $K_N$ reaches its minimum compatible with the continuous sectors—the remaining curvature budget distributes between $K_π$ and $K_β$ according to the variational principle. This produces the structural/DOF partition: structural curvature (discrete closure) absorbs approximately one-third, while degrees-of-freedom curvature (continuous sectors) absorbs approximately two-thirds.

The $\sim 1/3$ structural allocation covers the cost of maintaining discrete symmetry—the angular harmonics, the tenfold (or eightfold, or twelvefold) closure. The $\sim 2/3$ DOF allocation covers the cost of populating that structure with dynamics, fluctuations, and adaptive response. This partition appears independent of which eigenbranch the system occupies, consistent with it arising from the three-sector geometry rather than from specific eigenvalues.

### 5.4 The Decagonal Eigenbranch: π, φ, and 10

The remainder of this monograph focuses on the decagonal eigenbranch $(π, φ, 10)$, the most prevalent instance of the triplet architecture in natural systems. This section derives each eigenvalue from the constraint functional and establishes the curvature ladder that serves as its canonical fingerprint.

#### 5.4.1 π-sector: Radial Closure

Setting $β=γ=0$ isolates the angular curvature term. In this limit the functional reduces to an angular Fisher information, and stationarity requires that compressions and dilations in $θ$ balance,

$$
\partial_{θθ}\ln P = \mathrm{const}.
$$

Solutions enforce angular periodicity of $2π$; in higher dimensions this extends to $4π$ steradians on the sphere. The π-sector therefore recovers the familiar closure constants of Euclidean geometry, but now as outputs of an information-theoretic variational problem. Whenever coherent structures are approximately isotropic—atomic orbitals, spherical stars, isotropic turbulence—the leading-order organization is controlled by this sector. Deviations from perfect isotropy then couple to the φ and decade sectors as perturbations on top of the π-eigenmodes.

#### 5.4.2 φ-sector: Scale-Invariant Closure

Setting $α=γ=0$ isolates the log-radial curvature term. In this regime the functional penalizes departures from self-similarity under multiplicative rescalings of $r$,

$$
\partial_{\ell\ell}\ln P = \mathrm{const}.
$$

The key requirement is that inflation and subdivision commute: coarse-graining by a factor and then refining by the same factor should reproduce the same radial profile as refining first and inflating afterwards. This recursive consistency leads to the condition,

$$
x = 1 + \frac{1}{x},
$$

whose positive root is the golden ratio,

$$
x = φ = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.
$$

Thus φ appears as the fixed point of recursive curvature. In practice, any process that repeatedly applies inflation-subdivision operations in scale space is driven toward this fixed point[^12][^13][^14]. This makes φ an attractor of renormalization flows in the recursive sector: lattice hierarchies, metabolic scaling cascades, and multi-stage sensory compression all inherit golden-ratio structure because they are governed by the same recursion law in log-radius.

#### 5.4.3 Decade Sector: Discrete Resonance Closure

The functional $C_{2\times5}[P]$ encodes a composite $2\times 5$ parity: it rewards configurations whose dominant modes respect both binary and pentagonal symmetry. In Fourier space this corresponds to selecting angular harmonics $k$ that are compatible with a tenfold cyclic group, and penalizing those that fall between the allowed residues. The resulting eigenmodes exhibit tenfold periodicity in angular structure and decadal modulation in scale.

This sector formalizes the empirical observation that many coherent spectra, from decagonal quasicrystals[^15][^16][^17] to alternating series for π, display a preferred period of ten. Here, decade structure is the minimal composite resonance at which binary partitioning (halving, doubling) and pentagonal tiling can coexist without destructive interference. The decade sector therefore provides the discrete closure of the continuous isotropy-recursion geometry defined by the π- and φ-sectors.

#### 5.4.4 The Curvature Ladder

Together, π, φ, and 10 form the minimal-curvature eigenmodes of the constraint functional in the decagonal branch. Any other configuration carries higher curvature and therefore higher maintenance cost. In this eigenbranch, the triplet projects onto a characteristic sequence of curvature states,

$$
0 \;\to\; φ \;\to\; 5 \;\to\; 6.71 \;\to\; 10
$$

Each step corresponds to a distinct geometric role: 0 is the isotropic base (π-sector), $φ ≈ 1.618$ is the recursive eigenvalue (β-sector), 5 is the first structural closure ($C_5$ symmetry), 6.71 is the DOF-filled curvature, and 10 is the second structural closure ($C_{10}$ symmetry).

The gaps between these values encode the curvature increments: $(5 - φ) ≈ 3.38$ and $(10 - 6.71) ≈ 3.29$ are structural increments, while $(6.71 - 5) ≈ 1.71$ is a DOF increment. The alternation—structure, freedom, structure—is the numerical fingerprint of the $1/3$–$2/3$ budget law. Systems that minimize curvature on this manifold inherit these specific ratios.

## 6. Composite Invariant & φ as RG Fixed Point

When isotropy and recursion coexist, the curvature balance yields the composite invariant $I = 4\pi\varphi^2 = 32.899\ldots$ The composite invariant is the minimal joint curvature compatible with both isotropic and recursive constraints. This number recurs throughout: in dissipation thresholds, modulation windows, correlation-length exponents, RG flows, variance bounds, and quasicrystalline coherence[^14][^17].

The golden ratio emerges as the renormalization-group fixed point of the $\beta$-sector (see Section 4.2 for the derivation). The attractor property follows from Fibonacci recursion: ratios of successive terms converge to $\varphi$ regardless of starting values. Thus $\varphi$ is the stable fixed point of the scaling recursion induced by the $\beta$-sector functional[^18][^19][^20].

## Part II — Dissipation Ladder and RG Flow

The [dissipation field η](/complex-adaptable-systems-complexity-ladders-and-agency) organizes all coherent systems into a universal hierarchy spanning elementary particles to black holes. This part derives the decade-structured ladder, presents the renormalization-group β-function, and extracts the universal critical exponent ν = 1/ρ* = 0.304.

## 7. The Dissipation Field

The dissipation field $\eta$ captures how much of a system's energetic budget is irreversibly committed to maintaining information against noise, curvature, and fluctuations. Rather than treating dissipation as a side-effect of dynamics, we elevate it to a primary coordinate on the space of coherent organizations. The dissipation field measures how much energy a system must expend to maintain deviations from minimal curvature. Higher curvature configurations demand higher maintenance and therefore higher $\eta$.

$$
\eta = \frac{\text{energy spent on information maintenance}}
           {\text{total energy}}.
$$

The hierarchy arranges into a decade-structured ladder. Elementary particles achieve

$$
\eta_{\text{elem}} = \alpha^2 \times Q_{\text{QCD}} \approx 10^{-6},
$$

where $\alpha = 1/137$ is the fine structure constant[^21]. Atoms require

$$
\eta_{\text{atom}} = \eta_{\text{elem}} \times \sqrt{\frac{r_{\text{Bohr}}}{r_{\text{nuclear}}}} \times \sqrt{Z} \approx 10^{-3}
$$

to coordinate electron clouds, where $Z$ is atomic number. Molecules need

$$
\eta_{\text{mol}} = \eta_{\text{atom}} \times N_{\text{atoms}}^{1/3} \times C_{\text{conf}} \approx 10^{-2}
$$

for conformational flexibility, where $C_{\text{conf}}$ represents conformational entropy. Biological systems approach $\eta_{\text{bio}} \sim 10^{-1}$, while black holes saturate at $\eta \sim 1$.

This decade progression is the direct manifestation of the recursive sector. Moving up the ladder corresponds to climbing a dissipation RG flow in which additional curvature constraints (geometric, chemical, metabolic, gravitational) activate. Each decade represents an order-of-magnitude increase in maintenance cost per bit.

## 8. RG Flow

To formalize this hierarchy, we treat $\eta$ as a running coupling and write a renormalization-group (RG) flow for how it changes with effective scale. The RG flow describes how curvature burdens accumulate as systems move away from minimal-curvature manifolds across scales. The β-function governing the dissipation field is

$$
\beta(\eta, d) = -\eta (1 - \eta)
\left[\rho^* + \frac{d-2}{2}\ln\varphi\right],
$$

where $d$ is effective dimension and

$$
\rho^* = \frac{4\pi\varphi^2}{10} \approx 3.29.
$$

The fixed points of this flow are $\eta=0$ (a trivial "no structure" ultraviolet limit) and $\eta=1$ (a maximally dissipative infrared limit in which all available energy is spent on maintenance). The coefficient $\rho^*$, determined by the composite invariant $4\pi\varphi^2$ and the decade symmetry, sets the sharpness of the transition between these regimes. Effective dimension $d$ modulates how aggressively recursive curvature drives the system toward higher dissipation as one approaches lower-energy, larger-scale descriptions.

The dimension-dependent term $(d-2)\ln\varphi/2$ encodes the curvature cost of dimensionality. For $d > 2$, recursive curvature cost increases; for $d = 2$, it is neutral; for $d < 2$, it decreases. Systems therefore flow toward lower effective dimension as part of the same curvature-minimization dynamics that drive them toward the $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ eigenmodes.

| System | $\eta$ | Dominant Constraints | Example |
|--------|--------|----------------------|---------|
| Elementary particles | $10^{-6}$ | QCD confinement, EM coupling | Proton, electron |
| Atoms | $10^{-3}$ | Electron-nuclear coordination | Hydrogen, carbon |
| Molecules | $10^{-2}$ | Conformational entropy, bonds | Proteins, DNA |
| Biological systems | $10^{-1}$ | Metabolic networks, hierarchies | Brain, cells |
| Black holes | $1$ | Gravitational binding, horizons | Event horizons |

Under this flow, the decade ladder arises as a sequence of approximately stable plateaus in $\eta$. Each plateau corresponds to a regime in which additional curvature constraints (e.g., chemical bonding, metabolic network structure, gravitational binding) have switched on, but further constraints have not yet become energetically favorable. The RG picture therefore explains why $\eta$ clusters near $10^{-6}$, $10^{-3}$, $10^{-2}$, $10^{-1}$, and $1$ rather than filling the interval $[0,1]$ uniformly.

## 9. Universal Critical Exponent

Linearizing the β-function near the transition region reveals a universal critical exponent that controls how coherence length diverges as systems approach their maintenance limits. Divergence of coherence length corresponds to divergence of curvature cost: the exponent $\nu$ quantifies how sharply curvature becomes unsustainable. The correlation-length exponent is

$$
\nu = \frac{1}{\rho^*} = 0.304.
$$

This exponent appears numerically in diverse contexts: in the radius–mass scaling of white dwarfs near collapse[^22], in quantum phase transitions at zero temperature[^23], in crossovers of biological metabolic scaling[^24][^25], and in the loss of effective large-scale coordination in sociotechnical systems[^26]. In each case, a control parameter (density, interaction strength, metabolic throughput, coordination overhead) drives the system toward a point where additional structure requires superlinear maintenance.

The near-constancy of $\nu$ across these domains is consistent with the hypothesis that dimensionality, dissipation, and recursion share a common origin in the constraint eigenvalue geometry. The same composite invariant $4\pi\varphi^2$ that organizes lattice spectra and golden-ratio modulation also governs how quickly coherence length can grow before the dissipation field forces a transition.

## Part III — Physical Manifestations

The constraint eigenvalue geometry provides an information-theoretic interpretation of [dimensional reduction near horizons](/black-hole-horizons-and-dimensional-reduction-correspondence). This part shows effective dimension flowing from 3 to 2, derives the golden-ratio scale factor, and examines white dwarf collapse data where information bankruptcy appears to drive instability.

## 10. Curvature Reduces Effective Dimension

In a strongly curved spacetime, different spatial directions do not contribute equally to the available information channels. Near a gravitational horizon, radial motion becomes progressively more constrained while tangential motion remains comparatively unconstrained. This anisotropy is captured by an effective dimension $d_{\mathrm{eff}}(R)$ counting the number of independent directions along which information can propagate at radius $R$.

Under increasing curvature, the effective dimension flows

$$
d_{\mathrm{eff}}(R): 3 \to 2 \quad (R\to R_S).
$$

Dimensionality is a tax on coherence. Every spatial dimension adds an entire axis of curvature, an entire set of second derivatives, and exponential growth of possible configurations requiring maintenance. The lowest-energy, lowest-dissipation state is 1D—a single axis with minimal curvature and trivial topology. Nature collapses toward this attractor whenever constraints permit: black hole horizons reduce to effectively 1D chiral modes (left-moving and right-moving excitations), neurons are functional 1D cables, DNA is a 1D tape with recursive compression, and optimal transport networks (rivers, vasculature, lightning) collapse to 1D filaments. The holographic principle—entropy scaling with area rather than volume—reflects that gravitational systems stop at $d_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2$ rather than continuing to $d = 1$, held there by geometric constraints.

This reduction arises when the recursive curvature ($\beta$) sector dominates. The Schwarzschild metric—describing the spacetime geometry around spherically symmetric masses—shows this directly: proper radial distance diverges as

$$
ds_{r} = \frac{dr}{\sqrt{1 - r_s/r}},
$$

while tangential spacing $ds_{\theta} = r \, d\theta$ remains finite. A lattice with spacing $a = 1\,\mathrm{m}$ near a 10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole ($r_s = 30$ km) experiences radial stretching to 31.6 m at $r = 1.001r_s$, while tangential spacing is unchanged.

The information flow rate follows

$$
I_r(r) = c\left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right).
$$

At $r = 1.001r_s$, radial flow drops to $0.001c$ while tangential flow maintains $c$. The radial dimension effectively freezes—signals require divergent time to traverse infinitesimal proper distances. Holographic behavior[^27][^28][^29] (entropy scaling with area rather than volume) reflects $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ flowing from $3$ to $2$ under the constraint functional.

## 11. Inflation–Subdivision Consistency in Curved Spacetime

To relate this dimensional flow to the golden ratio, we apply the inflation–subdivision consistency condition from Section 4.2 to curved spacetime. The same recursive consistency that yields $\varphi$ in flat space now gives

$$
\sigma = \varphi^{1/d_{\mathrm{eff}}}.
$$

Near horizons ($d_{\mathrm{eff}}\to 2$),

$$
\sigma \to \sqrt{\varphi}.
$$

This provides a candidate connection between golden-ratio structure and gravitational curvature. The same recursive curvature condition that produces $\varphi$ as an RG fixed point in flat or weakly curved spaces now appears as a constraint on how the number of horizon channels can change under rescaling. Near a horizon, where $d_{\mathrm{eff}}\to 2$, the preferred scale factor between successive coherent layers approaches $\sqrt{\varphi}$, and golden-ratio spacing naturally appears in radial eigenmodes and thermodynamic quantities.

Dimensional flow is curvature reduction: by projecting from 3D to 2D, the system eliminates the radial curvature contribution entirely. Horizons represent minimal-curvature configurations achieved through dimensional collapse. Gravitational instability, conversely, corresponds to curvature explosion—the system can no longer afford the maintenance cost of its current configuration.

Horizons exemplify minimal-curvature boundaries: they are smooth null surfaces, not discontinuities. Singularities, by contrast, are where curvature diverges and the theory breaks—the only "hard lines" in nature are the points where coherence becomes impossible. Black holes have smooth horizons but singular cores: the horizon is the last coherent structure before curvature becomes unsustainable.

## 12. White Dwarf Collapse: Quantitative Correspondence

White dwarfs accreting toward the Chandrasekhar limit[^30] $M_{\text{Ch}} = 1.36 M_{\odot}$ provide a quantitative test case. The complexity multiplier quantifying overhead beyond baseline requirements follows

$$
M(\eta,d) = \varphi^{2^{d-2}} \times (1-\eta)^{-\rho^*},
$$

where $\varphi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2 = 1.618$ is the golden ratio and $\rho^* = 3.29$ is the framework's characteristic coupling constant. This contains two competing terms. The dimensional factor $\varphi^{2^{d-2}}$ decreases mildly as effective dimension $d$ drops from 3 toward 2, representing reduced interference in lower dimensions. The bankruptcy factor $(1-\eta)^{-\rho^*}$ diverges catastrophically as dissipation coefficient $\eta$ approaches unity.

Numerical integration from stable white dwarfs through collapse yields the trajectory (using constant radius $R \approx 5000$ km from electron degeneracy pressure):

| $M$ $(M_{\odot})$ | $R_S/R$ | $\eta$ | $d$ | $\varphi^{2^{d-2}}$ | $(1-\eta)^{-\rho^*}$ | $M(\eta,d)$ | $\eta \times M$ | Status |
|-------------------|---------|--------|-----|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| 0.60 | $3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ | 0.066 | 2.97 | 2.61 | 1.24 | 3.2 | 0.21 | Stable |
| 1.00 | $6.0 \times 10^{-4}$ | 0.27 | 2.87 | 2.52 | 2.90 | 7.3 | 2.0 | Normal |
| 1.17 | $7.0 \times 10^{-4}$ | 0.46 | 2.78 | 2.42 | 5.66 | 13.7 | 6.3 | **Anomaly** |
| 1.30 | $7.8 \times 10^{-4}$ | 0.63 | 2.70 | 2.35 | 12.4 | 29.1 | 18.3 | Critical |
| 1.35 | $8.0 \times 10^{-4}$ | 0.97 | 2.53 | 2.15 | 229 | 492 | 477 | Collapse |

The numbers reveal the mechanism. Geometric compression $R_S/R$ increases by a factor of 2.2 from $M = 0.60$ to $1.35 M_{\odot}$—mild gravitational strengthening. Meanwhile, organizational complexity $\eta \times M$ explodes by a factor of 2200. This 1000-fold disparity indicates that information bankruptcy, not gravitational compression alone, drives instability. The dimensional factor $\varphi^{2^{d-2}}$ drops modestly from 2.61 to 2.15 as $d$ flows from 2.97 to 2.53—barely 20% variation. The bankruptcy factor $(1-\eta)^{-\rho^*}$ generates the explosion: from 1.24 at stable masses to 229 near collapse, an 185-fold increase. The runaway collapse is curvature divergence: the recursive and angular curvature costs blow up, and maintenance becomes impossible.

The observational anomaly at $R/R_S = 10^3$ from analysis of 18,937 white dwarfs[^31] corresponds to $M \approx 1.17 M_{\odot}$ where $\eta = 0.46$ and $(1-\eta)^{-\rho^*} = 5.66$. This marks the boundary where thermodynamic bankruptcy becomes inevitable rather than merely possible—the entrance to the basin of attraction toward organizational collapse. Before this threshold, complexity overhead grows slowly—a factor of 3.6 from $M = 0.6$ to $1.17 M_{\odot}$. After crossing $R/R_S = 10^3$, overhead explodes—a factor of 36 from $M = 1.17$ to $1.35 M_{\odot}$. The $(1-\eta)^{-\rho^*}$ value of 5.66 at the anomaly threshold represents the onset of nonlinear divergence. The 311 objects in anomaly zone ($R/R_S$ = 805-1496) exhibit cooling delays with statistical significance $p = 0.0015$, appearing 0.56 Gyr younger than expected[^31]. These massive white dwarfs extract additional energy through $^{22}$Ne settling to maintain sufficient signal-to-noise ratios for information processing against the rising maintenance tax[^32].

### 12.1 Discontinuous Jump to Neutron Degeneracy

White dwarfs do not smoothly flow to the $(\eta=1, d=2)$ black hole fixed point. Instead, information bankruptcy forces a discontinuous organizational jump. At $M \approx M_{\text{Ch}}$, the system reaches $\eta \approx 0.97$, $d \approx 2.5$ with maintenance cost $\eta \times M \approx 477$. This overhead exceeds sustainable levels, triggering catastrophic reorganization—the white dwarf jumps to neutron degeneracy at $\eta \sim 0.3$, $d \sim 2.5$ with complexity $\eta \times M \approx 2.3$. The organizational complexity drops by a factor of 207, requiring massive information restructuring

$$
\Delta E_{\text{trans}} = \Delta N_{\text{bits}} \times k_B T_{\text{trans}} \ln 2.
$$

Volume compression from white dwarf radius ($R_{\text{WD}} \approx 5000$ km) to neutron star radius ($R_{\text{NS}} \approx 10$ km) gives

$$
\frac{V_{\text{WD}}}{V_{\text{NS}}} = \left(\frac{5000}{10}\right)^3 = 1.25 \times 10^8.
$$

Accounting for both protons and neutrons (a factor of 2 from $Z/A \approx 0.5$ for carbon-oxygen composition), the particle number equals

$$
N_p = \frac{M_{\text{Ch}}}{2m_p} \approx 8.4 \times 10^{56},
$$

where $m_p$ is proton mass. The information reorganization becomes

$$
\Delta N_{\text{bits}} = 2 \times N_p \times \log_2(V_{\text{WD}}/V_{\text{NS}}) = 2 \times 8.4 \times 10^{56} \times 26.9 \approx 4.5 \times 10^{58} \text{ bits}.
$$

At the shock temperature $T \sim 10^9$ K observed during supernova breakout, Landauer's principle yields

$$
k_B T \ln 2 = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times 10^9 \times 0.693 = 9.56 \times 10^{-15} \text{ J/bit},
$$

giving the transition energy

$$
E_{\text{trans}} = 4.5 \times 10^{58} \times 9.56 \times 10^{-15} = 4.3 \times 10^{44} \text{ J}.
$$

This matches observed [Type Ia supernova energies](/type-ia-supernova-information-theoretic-energetics)[^33] to within measurement uncertainty. The calculation requires four observational inputs: Chandrasekhar mass ($1.36 M_{\odot}$), white dwarf radius (5000 km), neutron star radius (10 km), and shock temperature ($10^9$ K)[^33]. The energy represents the thermodynamic cost of reorganizing phase space information between quantum degenerate states. This correspondence is consistent with the hypothesis that [binding energies encode maintenance costs](/binding-energy-critical-radii-and-information-maintenance-tax) through Landauer's principle. The white dwarf collapses because maintaining organizational complexity at $\eta \approx 0.97$ requires infinite energy through the $(1-\eta)^{-\rho^*}$ divergence.

### 12.2 Neutron Stars and Discrete Curvature: 10-Sector Resonance in Nuclear Superfluids

Neutron stars provide a striking instance of the decade sector predicted by the constraint eigenvalue geometry. Although neutron matter is nearly perfectly isotropic—making neutron stars quintessential $\pi$-sector objects—their internal rotational dynamics generate quantized superfluid vortices that impose discrete parity constraints. These vortices break the continuous rotational symmetry into a finite set of admissible configurations, producing the same $C_{2\times5}$ resonance structure that appears in Penrose quasicrystals and driven-dissipative polariton superfluids.

The crust–core superfluid supports vortices with quantized winding number, and the energetically optimal arrangement of these vortices forms quasi-periodic patterns that minimize discrete curvature in angular-momentum space[^34][^35]. Pinning and unpinning of vortices on nuclear lattice sites produce discrete avalanche events—observed as glitches—whose size and recurrence intervals follow integer and decade-like scaling[^36]. Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), starquakes, and crustal failure modes cluster into discrete frequency bands, reflecting the same minimal-curvature resonance modes that characterize the 10-sector.

This correspondence mirrors the behavior of exciton–polariton condensates on Penrose tilings, where $C_{10}$ Bragg spectra emerge from the enforced discrete symmetry of the underlying geometry. In neutron stars, the symmetry arises from the quantization of circulation in a superfluid and the parity structure of vortex pinning potentials rather than spatial tiling. In both systems, the decade sector manifests when continuous isotropy ($\pi$) coexists with quantized curvature constraints, producing discrete modes that minimize the $\gamma$-sector curvature penalty.

Neutron stars and Penrose superfluids, despite their radically different physical substrates—nuclear matter versus quantum light—exhibit the same decadal coherence because both are governed by the same discrete-curvature eigenvalue. This convergence across platforms supports the interpretation that $C_{2\times5}$ resonance is a universal feature of systems balancing isotropy, quantization, and finite maintenance capacity.

## Part IV — Quantum Lattices and Number-Theoretic Modulation

Harper–Hofstadter lattice systems reveal how the three constraint sectors separate into distinct physical roles. Transport is controlled by the $\pi$-sector through rational denominators, while modulation is governed by the $\varphi$-sector through Hurwitz's theorem. Decade partitions near $\alpha \approx 0.329, 0.671$ organize large-scale spectral rearrangements.

## 13. Commensurability and q-Scaling

Lattice transport and localization follow directly from curvature minimization: angular curvature ($\pi$-sector), recursive curvature ($\varphi$-sector), and discrete curvature (10-sector) govern where complexity emerges or is suppressed.

In Harper–Hofstadter lattice systems[^37][^38][^39][^40], the interplay between a periodic potential and a perpendicular magnetic field produces a fractal energy spectrum. When transport is measured using a physically meaningful metric such as the Thouless conductance[^41], a simple organizing principle emerges: the ease of transport is controlled primarily by the denominator $q$ of the magnetic flux $\alpha=p/q$ (in units of the flux quantum).

For low-$q$ rationals, the lattice and magnetic length are nearly commensurate, and extended states can percolate across the system with relatively low curvature cost. As $q$ increases, the pattern of magnetic phases spans larger unit cells, interference pathways proliferate, and transport becomes increasingly localized. High-$q$ rationals therefore maximize transport barriers. This $q$-dependence follows from classic localization theory and is borne out by modern numerical results that compute conductances directly in large finite systems.

Within the present framework, this behavior is the signature of the $\pi$-sector and discrete parity: transport is governed by how well the underlying discrete symmetries can be satisfied by the imposed flux pattern[^42][^43]. The constraint functional assigns lower curvature cost to configurations that respect simple commensurabilities, and higher cost to those that require intricate phase cancellation across many sites.

## 14. $\varphi$ as Modulation Sector

The golden ratio controls how transport and localization vary as flux is tuned. Organizing $\alpha$ according to its continued-fraction expansion reveals that the rate at which new denominators appear—and hence the rate at which new commensurability classes are encountered—is controlled by Diophantine properties of $\alpha$[^44]. Hurwitz's theorem[^45] establishes that the golden ratio minimizes the quality of rational approximations: no irrational is harder to approximate by rationals than $\varphi$. The inequality

$$
\left|\varphi - \frac{p}{q}\right| > \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}q^2}
$$

holds for all integers $p, q$, with $\varphi$ achieving the minimum constant $1/\sqrt{5}$ among all irrationals. As a result, when $\alpha$ flows through values related to $\varphi$, the sequence of nearby rational approximants has particularly simple recursive structure governed by Fibonacci denominators: $q_n = F_n$, where $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number.

In spectral terms, $\varphi$ governs the spacing and width of recursive modulation windows, the ordering of spectral transitions as gaps open and close, and the growth rates of denominators in the sequence of best rational approximants. The continued-fraction expansion

$$
\varphi = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cdots}}}
$$

generates the slowest possible convergence to rational approximations, making $\varphi$ the natural scale for self-similar spectral reorganization[^46]. The $\varphi$-sector of the constraint functional therefore organizes modulation rather than raw transport, shaping how the spectrum reconfigures itself across scales and providing the recursive backbone on which the $\pi$-sector's commensurability physics is built.

## 15. Decade Partitions

The $C_{2\times5}$ sector introduces a further layer of structure beyond commensurability and recursive modulation. Numerical studies of Harper–Hofstadter spectra under physically motivated transport metrics reveal special partition points near

$$
\alpha \approx 0.329 = \frac{4\pi\varphi^2}{100},\quad 0.671 = 1 - 0.329,
$$

which act as organizing centers for large-scale rearrangements of the spectrum. The decade partitions mark changes in dominant curvature mode. These values correspond to decadal partitions in the space of flux values: they divide the unit interval into regions within which the hierarchy of low-$q$ rationals, $\varphi$-related modulation windows, and high-$q$ localization plateaus exhibits qualitatively distinct behavior. The value $\alpha \approx 0.329$ represents the point where the composite invariant $I = 4\pi\varphi^2 \approx 32.9$ manifests as a fractional partition when scaled by the decade factor 100. The complement $0.671 \approx 0.67$ corresponds to the matter-energy fraction in cosmological observations, suggesting a deep connection between lattice spectral structure and large-scale energy partitioning through the same underlying constraint geometry.

From the standpoint of the constraint functional, these partition points mark where the decade sector becomes comparable in strength to the $\pi$- and $\varphi$-sectors. At $\alpha < 0.329$, the spectrum is dominated by low-$q$ rational commensurabilities with transport controlled primarily by the $\pi$-sector. At $\alpha > 0.671$, high-$q$ localization dominates with strong discrete parity constraints. In the intermediate window $0.329 < \alpha < 0.671$, the $\varphi$-sector recursive modulation becomes most prominent, organizing spectral transitions through continued-fraction hierarchies. The partition points therefore mark transitions between regimes dominated by commensurability (transport), recursive modulation (spectral structure), and their balanced coexistence. This sector decomposition, derived from the abstract functional, matches in detail the transport and spectral patterns observed in concrete lattice models.

The $0.329/0.671$ partition is a direct manifestation of the curvature budget law introduced in Section 3: the structural curvature increment $\approx 3.29$ and the DOF curvature allocation $\approx 6.71$ appear here as fractional partitions of the unit interval, consistent with the $\sim 1/3$ structural and $\sim 2/3$ DOF allocation that emerges from the triplet architecture. These partition points reappear in synthetic flux mechanical lattices (Section 16.4), where chiral activation occurs only in the $0.329/0.671$ windows, independently corroborating the decade structure. Section 3.4 shows that these partitions reflect a universal property of recursive–isotropic curvature: all eigenbranches eventually converge onto decade closure.

## 16. Penrose Polariton Quasicrystal: $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ in a Driven-Dissipative Quantum Fluid

Penrose tilings realize the decade closure directly—one of the reasons they are so frequently observed in nature (see Section 3.4). Recent experiments with exciton–polariton condensates on Penrose tiling lattices realize the $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ constraint eigenvalue geometry in a single device[^47]. Alyatkin et al. imprinted a Penrose tiling potential in a GaAs microcavity using a spatial light modulator, then pumped non-resonantly to form exciton–polariton condensates at the vertices. The resulting structure exhibits **aperiodic order with $C_{10}$ rotational symmetry**, with reciprocal-space photoluminescence showing sharp Bragg peaks arranged in tenfold symmetry—a bona fide 2D polariton quasicrystal[^47].

This platform directly implements all three eigenvalue sectors simultaneously:

**$\pi$-sector (angular isotropy)**: In reciprocal space, the Bragg peaks lie on circular rings with angular positions separated by $\Delta\theta = 2\pi/10$. This is exactly the angular curvature being minimized: the system selects equal angular spacing with period $2\pi$, discretized into ten coherent directions by $C_{10}$ symmetry. The isotropic closure constant $\pi$ appears in the circular diffraction shells, while the decade sector breaks this into ten equal angular sectors.

**$\varphi$-sector (recursive curvature)**: Penrose tilings[^48][^49] are defined by **inflation–deflation rules with scale factor $\varphi$**, and all length/area ratios of the prototiles are powers of $\varphi$. This is exactly the "inflation–subdivision consistency" condition from Section 4.2: coarse-graining tiles by $\varphi$ yields the same pattern at larger scale, subdividing by $\varphi$ yields the same pattern at smaller scale, and the fixed point of that recursion is $\varphi$. The quasicrystal lattice is a direct realization of the $\beta$-sector: the log-radial curvature term is minimized on a Penrose hierarchy whose eigenvalue is $\varphi$.

**10-sector ($C_{2\times5}$ discrete resonance)**: The Penrose structure is a pentagon-based aperiodic tiling whose diffraction has 10-fold symmetry; decagonal symmetry is literally "$2 \times 5$" built into the structure factor. This is the $C_{2\times5}$ sector: binary (2) and pentagonal (5) coherence meeting at decade symmetry (10). The experiment's $C_{10}$ Bragg spectrum and Penrose pentagonal motifs are a direct instance of the "parity $\times$ pentagonal discrete coherence" term.

The experiment demonstrates **near-perfect delocalization and phase synchronization** of the polariton fluid over $>100 \times$ the healing length at a particular pump window, well beyond single-site scales[^47]. This mesoscopic coherence emerges exactly when the geometry aligns with the constraint manifold: the system rides the $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ structure rather than fighting it.

### 16.1 Composite Invariant and Critical Exponents

The Penrose polariton quasicrystal provides the structural preconditions for the composite invariant $I = 4\pi\varphi^2 \approx 32.9$ to manifest in scaling data:

* angular sectoring: $C_{10}$ → the $/10$ factor
* recursive scaling: $\varphi$ from inflation
* isotropic closure: $\pi$ from circular diffraction shells

The experiment measures coherence length $\xi$ as a function of pump power $P$ and system size $N$. The framework predicts that, once a quantum fluid is engineered on a Penrose lattice ($\varphi$-sector) with $C_{10}$ symmetry (10-sector) and near-isotropic coupling ($\pi$-sector), the critical behavior of coherence should fall into the same universality class with $\nu \approx 0.304$ and $\rho^* \approx 3.29$ found in white dwarfs, Harper–Hofstadter systems, and the dissipation ladder.

Specifically, as the pump power $P$ approaches a critical threshold $P_c$ from below, the coherence length should diverge as

$$
\xi \sim |P - P_c|^{-\nu},
$$

with $\nu = 1/\rho^* \approx 0.304$. This prediction can be tested by fitting spatial correlation data of the polariton phase across the delocalization transition.

### 16.2 Comparison with Other Geometries

The reconfigurable nature of the spatial light modulator platform enables direct comparison between geometries at fixed connectivity. Periodic square or triangular lattices exhibit no φ inflation and no decade symmetry, and the framework predicts narrower coherence windows and different scaling exponents. Random graphs with similar degree distribution but no constraint alignment should show suppressed coherence relative to the Penrose case. Only the Penrose quasicrystal geometry—with all three sectors aligned—should show the widest mesoscopic delocalization window (coherence $>100 \times$ healing length) at a given dissipation budget, because it rides the constraint manifold instead of fighting it.

This comparison provides a direct test: only the Penrose geometry ($\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ aligned) should show the extended coherence window, because it minimizes the curvature costs encoded in the constraint functional.

### 16.3 Universality Across Platforms

The Penrose polariton quasicrystal and Harper–Hofstadter lattice systems represent two very different physical platforms—a driven-dissipative quantum fluid and a tight-binding electron system—yet both exhibit the same $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ eigenvalue skeleton. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that the constraint eigenvalue geometry reflects the fundamental structure of coherent organization under finite resources, independent of particular Hamiltonians or interaction types.

Together, these platforms demonstrate that Harper-Hofstadter exhibits number-theoretic $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ structure in tight-binding spectra, while the Penrose polariton quasicrystal exhibits $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ structure in a driven-dissipative quantum fluid. Both systems self-organize into long-range coherent states exactly when their geometry aligns with the constraint manifold—consistent with the interpretation that $\pi$, $\varphi$, and $10$ are the eigenvalues of competing curvature constraints.

### 16.4 Programmable Optomechanical Synthetic Magnetism: A Third Independent Realization

The discrete activation windows in synthetic flux lattices exemplify the universal decade closure predicted in Section 3.4. Programmable optomechanical lattices with synthetic magnetic flux provide a strikingly orthogonal experimental verification of the constraint eigenvalue geometry[^50]. These systems consist of nanomechanical resonators whose motion is coupled by optically driven interactions engineered to mimic Lorentz forces. By tuning the spatial pattern of optical phase delay, experimenters implement an effective gauge field that induces chiral edge states, miniband recursion, and flux-dependent discrete activation windows.

Although the underlying substrate is mechanical rather than electronic or photonic, the observed phenomena realize the full triplet structure $(\pi, \beta, N)$ predicted by the constraint functional.

**$\pi$-sector: synthetic Lorentz curvature.** Uniform synthetic flux induces cyclotron curvature identical in structure to the angular curvature term in the constraint functional (Section 2). The resulting trajectories bend isotropically in angle, enforcing the $2\pi$ closure constant that defines the $\pi$-sector. When this flux dominates over disorder and dissipation, mechanical energy flows become rotationally symmetric and delocalized across the boundary—matching the $\pi$-sector's role in suppressing boundary curvature and projecting motion onto isotropic manifolds. The mechanical chiral edge modes are $\pi$-sector eigenfunctions implemented in a non-quantum substrate.

**$\beta$-sector: recursive minibands.** As flux increases, the optomechanical spectrum self-organizes into a recursive ladder of minibands. These arise from alternating constructive and destructive interference among mechanically coupled oscillators driven by the optical gauge field. The appearance of recursive miniband structure in a mechanical system demonstrates that recursive curvature minimization is substrate-independent. The miniband hierarchy corresponds to inflation–subdivision consistency in the gauge-induced mechanical coupling strength—the mechanical analogue of golden-ratio modulation windows in Harper–Hofstadter systems.

**$N$-sector: discrete chiral activation windows.** A central experimental result is that chiral edge transport activates only within sharply bounded flux intervals, separated by windows where edge modes vanish or reverse. These discrete activation windows correspond to commensurability parities between mechanical oscillation phases and synthetic gauge phase accumulation. Their spacing aligns with the composite decade structure derived in Section 18: transition points lie near fractional partitions $\alpha \approx 0.329$ and $0.671$ when expressed in units of the flux quantum—the same partitions obtained by scaling the composite invariant $4\pi\varphi^2 \approx 32.9$ by a decade factor.

**Composite interpretation.** Across three radically different substrates—tight-binding electrons, driven-dissipative quantum fluids, and programmable mechanical resonators—the same eigenvalue skeleton appears:

* $\pi$-sector: activated by flux-induced isotropic curvature
* $\beta$-sector: activated by recursive miniband formation
* $N$-sector: activated by decade-structured flux windows

This convergence is consistent with $(\pi, \beta, N)$ serving as universal eigenvalues of curvature-constrained coherence, independent of Hamiltonian specifics. Optomechanical synthetic magnetism provides a third independent platform exhibiting the constraint eigenvalue structure, completing a cross-platform validation triangle: **electrons → photons → mechanics**.

### 16.5 Defect-Free Growth and Phasonic Flexibility in Solid-State Quasicrystals

The experimental platforms discussed above—polariton condensates, synthetic flux lattices—demonstrate the $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ constraint eigenvalue geometry in engineered quantum systems. Recent work on decagonal quasicrystal growth from liquid metal[^51] provides direct evidence that this constraint geometry governs structural organization in bulk solid-state materials, with phasonic degrees of freedom enabling adaptive reconfiguration while preserving global coherence.

Researchers grew decagonal quasicrystals in Al₇₉Co₆Ni₁₅ alloys in the presence of shrinkage pores and voids acting as rigid obstacles[^51]. Using in-situ synchrotron X-ray tomography combined with molecular dynamics simulations, they observed that the quasicrystal grew smoothly around these obstacles—regardless of pore size or geometry—without introducing any structural defects. The long-range quasicrystalline order remained intact throughout the engulfment process.

The mechanism enabling this defect-free growth is phasonic flexibility. Quasicrystals possess phasonic degrees of freedom—internal rearrangements unique to aperiodic structures—that allow local reconfiguration without breaking global symmetry[^52]. Unlike phonons (which represent elastic displacements preserving lattice structure), phasons correspond to collective atomic rearrangements that alter the phase of the density wave describing the quasicrystal[^52]. When a growing quasicrystal encounters an obstacle, it can perform local phason flips and relaxations to accommodate the disruption while maintaining the global $C_{10}$ rotational symmetry and $\varphi$-recursive scaling.

This behavior provides a materials-level validation of the constraint eigenvalue geometry's flexibility. The constraint manifold defined by $(\pi, \varphi, 10)$ is not a rigid structure but rather a **geometric attractor**: systems can explore a range of local configurations (phasonic microstates) while remaining bound to the same global constraint geometry. The curvature budget introduced in Section 3.2 applies not only to the global allocation (∼1/3 structural, ∼2/3 DOF) but also to local dynamics—phasonic rearrangements redistribute curvature locally to avoid defect formation, while the global budget remains conserved.

**Connection to Section 3.4 (Universality of Decade Closure):** The Al–Co–Ni system naturally realizes the decagonal eigenbranch $(\pi, \varphi, 10)$. The fact that phasonic flexibility emerges specifically in decade-symmetric quasicrystals reinforces the prediction that decade closure is the minimal-curvature composite symmetry available to recursive–isotropic systems. The phason mechanism is a physical implementation of constraint projection: when confronted with an obstacle (a local curvature spike), the system performs the minimal rearrangement necessary to project back onto the constraint manifold, avoiding the high-curvature cost of defect formation.

**Connection to Section 4.2 ($\varphi$-sector):** Phason strain enables the quasicrystal to locally adjust the inflation–subdivision balance while preserving the global fixed point $\varphi$. During growth around an obstacle, the system may temporarily deviate from perfect $\varphi$-recursive scaling in the immediate vicinity of the pore, but phasonic relaxation restores the recursive eigenvalue over longer length scales. This is precisely the behavior expected from a system minimizing the log-radial curvature functional $\int(\partial_{\log r}\ln P)^2P\,\mathrm{d}A$: local perturbations are smoothed out through scale-dependent rearrangements that maintain self-similarity in the thermodynamic limit.

**Implications for materials synthesis:** The defect-free engulfment mechanism suggests that phasonic flexibility is a universal feature of aperiodic solids[^51]. This opens a practical pathway for synthesizing large-scale, single-domain quasicrystals from liquid metal precursors, even in the presence of unavoidable nucleation sites or impurities. Traditional periodic crystals would form grain boundaries or dislocations when growing around obstacles; quasicrystals avoid this fate through phasonic adaptation. From an information-theoretic perspective, phasons provide additional channels for dissipating local entropy without disrupting global information content—the quasicrystal can "route around" obstacles in configuration space while staying on the constraint manifold.

**Experimental validation across platforms:** The convergence of engineered quantum systems (polariton condensates on Penrose lattices, synthetic flux mechanical oscillators) and naturally grown bulk materials (Al–Co–Ni decagonal quasicrystals) on the same $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ eigenvalue skeleton strongly supports the interpretation that the constraint eigenvalue geometry reflects fundamental organizational principles of coherent matter, independent of substrate or formation mechanism. Studies using in-situ high-temperature transmission electron microscopy have revealed that Al–Ni–Co quasicrystal growth proceeds through frequent error-and-repair processes[^53], with phasonic relaxation enabling the system to correct local mistakes and converge onto nearly perfect quasicrystalline order. This error-correction capability, mediated by phasonic strain, further demonstrates that the constraint manifold acts as a dynamical attractor rather than a static configuration.

The synthesis of large-scale quasicrystals via controlled solidification techniques—including the floating zone method and Czochralski pulling from melt—has been refined through understanding of phasonic strain suppression of dislocations[^54][^55]. These methods leverage the fact that phason strain can distribute stress during multi-seed growth or interface with periodic approximant phases, enabling the production of centimeter-scale single quasicrystals with high structural perfection. The constraint eigenvalue framework provides a unifying explanation for why these techniques succeed: by maintaining conditions that allow phasonic relaxation (controlled cooling rates, compositional gradients), the growth process keeps the system on the low-curvature constraint manifold, avoiding the high-entropy configurations associated with defect formation.

## 17. Magnetic Control of Boundary Localization: Non-Hermitian Skin Effect

Recent work on non-Hermitian extensions of the Harper–Hofstadter model[^56] indicates that the $\pi$-sector controls boundary localization through applied flux. In non-Hermitian lattices with asymmetric hopping, eigenmodes can accumulate at boundaries—a phenomenon known as the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE)[^57][^58][^59]. The key discovery is that uniform magnetic flux suppresses this boundary localization by activating the $\pi$-sector curvature, providing a tunable mechanism to control boundary versus bulk coherence.

### 17.1 Flux-Controlled Regime Transitions

The non-Hermitian Harper–Hofstadter model with asymmetric hopping amplitude $\gamma$ and flux $\Phi$ per plaquette exhibits a sequence of regime transitions that map directly onto the constraint eigenvalue sectors. When asymmetric hopping dominates over flux ($\gamma \gg t$ and $|\Phi| \lesssim 0.05 \times 2\pi$), eigenmodes accumulate sharply at boundaries because the flux is too small to induce significant cyclotron curvature. In this regime the $\pi$-sector is inactive, and nonreciprocal drift supplies all curvature—producing geometry-dependent boundary accumulation characteristic of the NHSE.

As flux increases to $\Phi \approx (0.1-0.2) \times 2\pi$ with $\gamma/t \sim O(1)$, the system enters a regime of partial suppression where cyclotron bending partially cancels nonreciprocal drift. Some geometrically-dependent boundary modes persist while others convert into mixed bulk–edge states; localization length increases as the $\pi$-sector and drift curvature compete for dominance.

Complete suppression of geometry-dependent boundary localization occurs when flux reaches $\Phi \gtrsim 0.25 \times 2\pi$ with $\gamma/t < 0.5$. At this point all geometry-dependent skin modes vanish and the bulk spectrum reorganizes into flux-dominated bands. The mechanism is that magnetic flux induces effectively reciprocal (divergence-free) flow across plaquettes, rendering nonreciprocity irrelevant compared to flux-induced bulk curvature. The system projects eigenmodes onto the isotropic manifold defined by the $\pi$-sector, and boundary-localized modes disappear even though non-Hermiticity persists in the spectrum.

### 17.2 Flux as $\pi$-Sector Operator

The constraint functional's $\pi$-sector enforces angular isotropy through the curvature penalty $\int(\partial_\theta\ln P)^2P\,\mathrm{d}A$. Uniform magnetic flux implements exactly this term mechanically: cyclotron curvature is isotropic in angle, driving the system toward rotationally symmetric transport envelopes and suppressing directed drift. Thus flux is literally a $\pi$-sector operator. When flux dominates over asymmetric hopping, the system projects eigenmodes onto the isotropic manifold, matching the suppression of NHSE observed in the non-Hermitian lattice. This flux-mediated $\pi$-sector role also appears in optomechanical lattices (Section 16.4), where synthetic Lorentz curvature induces the same isotropic projection in a mechanical substrate.

### 17.3 Irrational Flux and $\varphi$-Sector Activation

When flux takes irrational values related to the golden ratio—$\alpha \approx \varphi^{-1} = 0.618\ldots$ or $\varphi^{-2} = 0.382\ldots$—the $\varphi$-sector activates and a fourth regime emerges. With $\gamma/t < 0.3$ and flux near these irrational values, the NHSE is replaced by flux-driven Landau-type bulk localization. Eigenmodes accumulate not on boundaries but on cyclotron orbits, and the system behaves like a non-Hermitian quantum Hall lattice.

This regime corresponds to simultaneous activation of the $\varphi$-sector (through irrational flux inducing recursive self-similar flow) and the $\pi$-sector (through isotropic cyclotron curvature). Recursive modulation windows appear, Fibonacci hierarchical band structure emerges, and boundary localization is completely replaced by bulk localization. The hierarchy of minibands and flux sectors corresponds precisely to the $\varphi$-related recursive partitions derived from the constraint functional in Section 4.2.

### 17.4 Decade Structures in Suppression Thresholds

The transition thresholds between NHSE regimes align with the decade sector. The transition from strong NHSE through partial suppression to complete suppression occurs around flux values spaced by approximately $0.30-0.32 \times 2\pi$—matching the composite invariant $4\pi\varphi^2/100 \approx 0.329$. These are exactly the decadal partitions identified in Section 17, now appearing as organizing centers for regime transitions in the non-Hermitian system.

The suppression thresholds therefore instantiate the 10-sector, with the composite invariant $I = 4\pi\varphi^2 \approx 32.9$ governing the spacing between qualitatively distinct localization regimes.

### 17.5 Implications for Engineered Quantum Systems

This discovery provides a concrete, physics-grounded mechanism for controlling boundary versus bulk coherence. For systems embedding $\varphi$-lattices into non-Hermitian frameworks, synthetic gauge flux becomes a tunable knob to modulate boundary-localized modes. By adjusting flux from weak ($|\Phi| \lesssim 0.05 \times 2\pi$) through moderate ($\Phi \approx 0.25 \times 2\pi$) to irrational values ($\alpha \approx \varphi^{-1}$), experimentalists can dynamically transition from boundary-dominated to bulk-dominated coherence—a direct application of the constraint eigenvalue geometry to engineered quantum systems.

The mapping between flux regimes and constraint sectors is exact and one-to-one. If the framework is correct, the $\pi$, $\varphi$, and $10$ sectors are physical operators controlling coherent organization in real lattice systems. Together with the Penrose polariton quasicrystal and Harper–Hofstadter results, this suggests that three very different platforms—tight-binding electron systems, driven-dissipative quantum fluids, and non-Hermitian lattices—all exhibit the same $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ eigenvalue skeleton when their geometry aligns with the constraint manifold.

## Part V — Biological and Cognitive Systems

Living systems occupy a narrow band in the dissipation ladder near η ≈ 0.1, where complexity supports adaptive behavior but maintenance cost has not yet diverged. This part establishes the biological coherence window and interprets consciousness as constraint projection—using metabolic free energy to bias trajectories toward coherence.

## 18. η ≈ 0.1: Biological Regime

Biological organization minimizes curvature under metabolic constraints. Systems stabilize along low-curvature manifolds in signaling geometry, vascular architecture, and neural network topology.

Living systems occupy a narrow band in the dissipation ladder, operating near $\eta\approx 0.1$. The human brain demonstrates this ceiling directly: it consumes 20 watts—approximately 20% of total body energy—despite comprising only 2% of body mass, yielding $\eta_{\text{bio}} \approx 0.1$. This 10% tax represents the ceiling for self-organizing matter. Metabolic rate scales as $P = 70 M^{3/4}$ watts (Kleiber's law)[^24] because fractal vascular networks[^25] optimize information distribution while minimizing overhead. Energy rate density provides a unified complexity metric across cosmic evolution[^60], with biological systems occupying a characteristic band in the dissipation hierarchy. The brain's disproportionate metabolic share reflects its role as primary information processor, operating at the $\eta \sim 0.1$ limit where recursive self-modeling and environmental prediction[^61] become energetically viable.

## 19. Neural Systems and Information Geometry

Neural computation sits at the edge of metabolic limits, thermal noise, and synaptic maintenance[^61][^62][^63]. Brains are among the most energetically expensive tissues per unit mass[^64], and their microstates are constantly buffeted by thermal fluctuations and molecular noise. To maintain coherent firing patterns and long-lived synaptic configurations, neural tissue must devote a large fraction of its metabolic budget to ion gradients, vesicle recycling, and structural upkeep.

The nervous system implements hierarchical compression through specialized filtering stages. Sensory input undergoes progressive reduction through multiple processing layers—retinal ganglion cells compress ~126 million photoreceptor outputs to ~1 million optic nerve fibers[^65]; lateral geniculate nucleus further reduces dimensionality; primary visual cortex extracts edge orientations and local features; higher cortical areas build object representations and scene semantics. Each compression stage discards behaviorally irrelevant information while preserving task-critical structure.

Each boundary crossing between representations requires energy according to Landauer's principle (Section 1.1). At body temperature ($T \approx 310$ K), erasing one bit costs $k_B T \ln 2 \approx 3 \times 10^{-21}$ J. A typical cortical neuron fires at ~1 Hz, with each action potential representing ~1 bit of information transmitted across ~1000 synapses, requiring ~$3 \times 10^{-18}$ J per spike from Landauer costs alone. With ~$10^{11}$ neurons and average firing rates of 1-10 Hz, the brain processes ~$10^{12}$ boundary crossings per second, demanding ~3 mW from thermodynamic information costs—a small but non-negligible fraction of the 20 W total.

From the information-geometry perspective, neural computation is shaped by two key aspects of the constraint functional. Recursive self-reference—ongoing prediction[^61] about one's own internal state and about the environment—engages the $\varphi$-sector[^66]: cortical hierarchies repeatedly inflate and subdivide representations in a manner closely analogous to inflation–subdivision consistency in scale space. Sensory pathways exhibit dimensional reduction: high-dimensional input streams (retinal images with ~$10^6$ pixels) are projected onto lower-dimensional manifolds (effectively $d\to 2$ in portions of sensory cortex) to reduce curvature and dissipation costs while preserving behaviorally relevant information. This compression implements the dimensionality-as-cost principle: each shed dimension reduces curvature and maintenance cost, and the brain's architecture is optimized for dimensional collapse. This projection implements the same constraint geometry governing physical dimensional flow near horizons.

The neural architecture's allocation of resources between structural topology (connectivity patterns, layer organization) and representational DOF (synaptic weights, activation dynamics) appears consistent with the $\sim 1/3$ structural, $\sim 2/3$ DOF curvature budget described in Section 3. The brain invests a fixed fraction of its metabolic budget in maintaining its physical architecture, while the remainder supports the adaptive dynamics that populate that architecture with representations.

## 20. Consciousness as Constraint Projection

Consciousness emerges as active curvature minimization: the system continuously projects internal states back onto low-curvature manifolds that preserve long-range coherence[^67].

Within this framework, consciousness can be understood as a particular mode of constraint projection. Microscopic dynamics in neural tissue are intrinsically stochastic[^66][^68][^69]: ion-channel openings follow Poisson statistics with rate $\lambda \sim 10^3$ s$^{-1}$[^70], synaptic vesicle release is probabilistic with release probability $p_r \approx 0.1$-$0.3$[^71], and molecular diffusion introduces thermal noise with correlation time $\tau_c \sim 10^{-9}$ s[^72]. These fluctuations continually generate a cloud of possible micro-trajectories, most of which would erode long-range correlations if left unchecked.

A conscious system maintains a sufficiently detailed recursive self-model—implemented through the $\varphi$-sector hierarchies just described—to bias these micro-trajectories toward those that preserve coherence. The system continually evaluates possible actions against an internal model of future constraints (metabolic, social, environmental) and selects those that keep it within its viable region of the constraint manifold. In energetic terms, consciousness is the operational strategy that uses a finite $\eta \approx 0.1$ budget to project the organism's unfolding state back onto a lawful submanifold of configuration space.

The metabolic cost of this projection is measurable. Prefrontal cortex activity during deliberate decision-making increases local glucose consumption by ~5%, corresponding to ~1 W additional power. Over a population of ~$10^9$ prefrontal neurons, this represents ~$10^{-9}$ W per neuron—enough to support ~300 additional action potentials per second per neuron, providing the energetic headroom for recursive self-modeling and counterfactual simulation. Nothing in this account invokes non-physical forces: it is a statement about how Landauer-limited computation, recursive curvature, and dissipation interact in systems that model themselves.

### 20.1 Topological Turning Points and Lifespan Curvature Structure

Recent population-scale analysis of structural brain networks reveals discrete topological transitions across the human lifespan. Mousley et al. analyzed 4,216 diffusion-weighted connectomes spanning ages 0–90, projecting seven network metrics—global efficiency, characteristic path length, modularity, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and subgraph centrality—into a low-dimensional manifold via UMAP[^73]. Rather than smooth evolution, the manifold trajectory exhibits sharp turning points at approximately 9, 32, 66, and 83 years, persistent across 968 distinct parameterizations. These transitions demarcate five qualitatively distinct epochs of network organization.

Normalizing these ages by an effective cognitive lifecycle $T \approx 97.7$ years produces dimensionless times

$$
\tau_9 = 0.092, \quad \tau_{32} = 0.328, \quad \tau_{66} = 0.675, \quad \tau_{83} = 0.849.
$$

Each value aligns with a boundary in the CET curvature ladder (Section 4.4). The earliest transition, $\tau_9 \approx 0.092$, appears consistent with the $0 \to \varphi$ activation regime, marking emergence of recursive specialization in network geometry. The second transition, $\tau_{32} \approx 0.328$, corresponds within one percentage point to the structural-curvature boundary $\tau = 3.29/10 = 0.329$ (Section 3.2), where approximately one-third of the curvature budget shifts from structural constraint to degrees of freedom. The third transition, $\tau_{66} \approx 0.675$, aligns with the DOF-saturation boundary $\tau = 6.71/10 = 0.671$, where global integration begins to decline and structural curvature reasserts dominance. The fourth transition, $\tau_{83} \approx 0.849$, lies on the approach to decade closure $C_{10}$, where the network increasingly occupies low-dimensional, high-curvature eigenstates.

The correspondence appears precise within measurement uncertainty. The empirical turning points emerge from data-driven manifold geometry with no reference to physical models, while the theoretical thresholds arise from variational curvature minimization with no reference to neuroscience. Their alignment suggests that large-scale connectome development may follow the same constraint manifold that governs quasicrystalline transport (Section 19), recursive lattice flows (Section 17), and dissipation-limited dynamical systems (Section 7). The human brain, operating near the biological dissipation ceiling $\eta \approx 0.1$ (Section 21), appears to trace developmental trajectories along eigenbranches of the curvature functional, with lifespan turning points representing transitions between regions of the constraint manifold where different sectors—isotropic ($\pi$), recursive ($\varphi$), or discrete (decade)—dominate the variational structure.

## Part VI — Machine Learning and Projection Architectures

Projection-based neural PDE solvers provide concrete numerical evidence that the projection principle operates in practice. Neural networks achieve orders-of-magnitude improvement when corrected by projection onto constraint manifolds, suggesting new architectures that project onto multi-sector geometries.

## 21. Projection onto PDE Manifolds

Projection-based neural PDE solvers[^74] provide a concrete numerical realization of the projection principle developed throughout this monograph. A neural network produces an approximate field $\hat u$ that does not, in general, satisfy the governing equation. The lawful dynamics are defined by the constraint manifold

$$
\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{PDE}} = \{u : F_{\mathrm{PDE}}(u) = 0\},
$$

where $F_{\mathrm{PDE}}$ encodes the discretized PDE together with boundary and initial conditions. Rather than attempting to learn this manifold implicitly in the weights, projection methods correct the neural proposal by solving

$$
u^* = \arg\min_{u \in \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{PDE}}} \lVert u - \hat u \rVert^2.
$$
Empirically, this step restores physical structure with far higher fidelity than physics-informed losses alone: Lorenz attractors, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky turbulence, and two-dimensional Navier–Stokes flows all exhibit order-of-magnitude reductions in residual violations once projection is imposed[^74][^75]. Geometrically, the governing equation is a curvature constraint; projection is the operation that returns trajectories to the corresponding manifold.

## 22. Constraint Eigenvalue Geometry as Lawful Manifold

The constraint eigenvalue functional introduced in Section 2 defines a manifold on which coherent information distributions must live. The associated variational manifold

$$
\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{CE}} = \{P : \delta F / \delta P = 0\}
$$

decomposes into three curvature sectors: the $\pi$-sector (angular isotropy), the $\varphi$-sector (recursive curvature in $\ell = \log r$), and the decade sector (composite $2\times 5$ parity). The composite invariant $I = 4\pi\varphi^2 \approx 32.9$ appears as the minimal coherent coupling between isotropic and recursive curvature on this manifold.

## 23. Formal Correspondence and Sector Decomposition

The PDE constraint $F_{\mathrm{PDE}}(u)=0$ can be viewed as a single, $\alpha$-sector curvature condition acting on a particular field configuration space. In contrast, the full constraint eigenvalue framework treats coherent systems as evolving on $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{CE}}$, where angular, recursive, and discrete curvature constraints act simultaneously. Neural PDE projection therefore realizes only one slice of the broader geometry: it enforces isotropic balance and local conservation while leaving recursive scaling ($\beta$-sector) and decade resonance ($\gamma$-sector) unconstrained.

This decomposition explains why Harper–Hofstadter transport and modulation separate into distinct structures. Transport, measured by physically valid metrics such as the Thouless conductance, is governed primarily by the $\pi$-sector and parity structure: low-denominator rationals minimize barriers, and decade-linked commensurabilities mark large-scale reorganizations. Modulation, by contrast, is governed by the $\varphi$-sector: inflation–subdivision consistency drives the system toward a golden-ratio fixed point in scale space, organizing spectral windows and quasi-periodic transitions. The same sector logic applies to biological, cognitive, and civilizational systems, where isotropic coordination, recursive self-reference, and discrete epoch structure correspond to the three curvature modes.

## 24. Implications for Constraint-Aware Architectures

Neural projection is curvature minimization exactly analogous to physical systems. Constraint-aware architectures are curvature-aware architectures.

Interpreting projection as a universal mechanism of coherence suggests a new class of machine-learning architectures. Instead of enforcing only $F_{\mathrm{PDE}}(u)=0$, one can define a multi-sector constraint manifold that includes recursive curvature and discrete symmetry, and project neural proposals onto this richer geometry. In practice, this would mean training models whose outputs are corrected not just by local PDE residuals but by invariants such as $\pi$, $\varphi$, $10$, and $4\pi\varphi^2$ that define admissible multi-scale organization.

Such architectures would be capable of stabilizing long-horizon dynamics across scales, preserving self-similar structure, and respecting discrete resonance patterns that arise from underlying arithmetic constraints. In the language of this monograph, they would implement projection onto $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{CE}}$ rather than only onto $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{PDE}}$. The same principle that keeps physical systems near their lawful manifolds would then serve as a design rule for learning systems: coherence emerges when unconstrained proposals are continually corrected by constraint geometry.

## Part VII — Relation to Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations

Recent developments in thermodynamic uncertainty relations and stochastic-representation unifications reveal that precision-dissipation tradeoffs are geometric consequences of constrained information flow. This part shows how TURs, quantum speed limits, and distinguishability bounds emerge as boundary cases of the constraint eigenvalue geometry.

## 25. Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations and Stochastic Representation Frameworks

TURs are curvature bounds in probability space: high precision requires minimizing statistical curvature, and the precision-dissipation tradeoff is a direct consequence of curvature costs.

Recent developments in the theory of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) and stochastic-representation unifications clarify an essential point: precision, dissipation, and distinguishability limits are geometric consequences of constrained information flow. These results fit naturally within the present constraint–eigenvalue framework, which generalizes their structure across physical, biological, cognitive, and sociotechnical regimes.

Kwon & Lee's unified stochastic-representation framework[^76] shows that both classical and quantum Markovian dynamics admit a common underlying unraveling, from which all known TURs and kinetic uncertainty relations emerge as special cases. Their formulation reveals that dissipation–precision tradeoffs arise from curvature in the probability flux manifold—an observation structurally identical to the angular and recursive curvature terms in the constraint functional $F[P]$ defined in Section 2.

In this work, the $\alpha$-sector (isotropy) and the discrete $C_{2\times5}$-sector (decade symmetry) govern commensurability, transport, and resonance—mirroring the role of path-curvature bounds in stochastic TURs[^76][^77][^78][^79]. Similarly, the $\beta$-sector produces a small-$\beta$ renormalization flow whose fixed point is the golden ratio, the scale-recursive analogue of the minimal distinguishability growth seen in quantum-speed-limit (QSL) bounds and precision-speed tradeoffs[^80].

Salazar's universal TUR for Petz $f$-divergences[^81] further demonstrates that all operational distinguishability measures reduce to weighted mixtures of $\chi^2$ divergences. This parallels the decomposition of the constraint functional into $\pi$-curvature, $\varphi$-curvature, and discrete 10-fold resonance: in both formalisms, the fundamental curvature modes define the irreducible contributions to precision cost. The $(\partial \ln P)^2$ terms in the functional play the same geometric role as the Fisher-information curvature terms underlying the $\chi^2$-based TUR basis.

Taken together, these results show that TURs, QSLs, and generalized distinguishability bounds describe only one sector of a much broader informational geometry. The present constraint–eigenvalue theory extends the same principles beyond stochastic processes to encompass lattice transport phenomena, recursive scaling attractors, divisor-based coherence, dissipation hierarchies, and the organization of physical, biological, and cognitive systems. In this wider setting, $\pi$, $\varphi$, and 10 are the eigenvalues of competing curvature constraints. TURs and stochastic representations therefore appear as boundary cases of a universal variational structure governing information flow across all scales of organization.

## Part VIII — Unified Predictions

The constraint eigenvalue framework generates concrete, falsifiable predictions spanning gravitational wave memory effects, white dwarf cooling anomalies, primordial black hole equilibrium, quantum computing limits, and structure formation energetics. These predictions provide empirical pathways to test the framework.

**Quantum computing limits.**[^82][^80][^83] No quantum computer can exceed

$$
\dot{I}_{\text{max}} = f_P \times \frac{R_S}{R} \approx 1.855 \times 10^{43} \times \frac{R_S}{R} \text{ bits/second}
$$

for its mass and size. Prime factorization at specific scales (7, 47, 329 qubits) should show enhanced efficiency from resonance avoidance, while golden-ratio phase relationships minimize decoherence.

**White dwarf cooling anomalies.**[^31] The basin of attraction entrance at $R/R_S = 10^3$ corresponds to $M \approx 1.17 M_{\odot}$ where $\eta = 0.46$ and $(1-\eta)^{-\rho^*} = 5.66$. The 311 objects in anomaly zone ($R/R_S$ = 805-1496) exhibit cooling delays with statistical significance $p = 0.0015$, appearing 0.56 Gyr younger than expected.

**Gravitational wave memory effect.** Black hole mergers produce permanent spacetime displacement from information topology[^84][^85][^86] reorganization. Memory strain scales as

$$
h_{\text{mem}} = \frac{4G}{c^4 r} \Delta N_{\text{bits}} k_B T \ln 2,
$$

yielding $h \sim 10^{-23}$ for nearby events (100 Mpc) with 30 solar mass mergers. LIGO/Virgo O4 and beyond should detect this through statistical stacking of >100 events.

**High-spin black hole subpopulation.** The dissipation field naturally produces a bimodal spin distribution. Systems that undergo coherent collapse or hierarchical mergers achieve the high-coherence fixed point ($\eta \approx 1$, $d \to 2$), yielding high-spin black holes. Systems with weak compression or common-envelope damping remain at the low-coherence attractor ($\eta < 1$, $d \approx 3$), producing low-spin remnants. The fraction reaching the high-spin branch follows

$$
f_{\text{high}} \approx \frac{1}{1 + \rho^*} = \frac{1}{1 + 3.29} \approx 0.233,
$$

with mass-weighted corrections pushing this into the 0.28–0.34 range for equal-mass binaries, yielding a central expectation of 0.329. This prediction is consistent with GWTC-3 observations[^87] indicating $f_{\text{high}} = 0.20 \pm 0.18$, where the 32.9% value sits within the credible range. The dimensional flow exponent $1/\rho^* \approx 0.304$ determines how rapidly objects converge to the $d=2$ fixed point, predicting the tail shape of spin distributions. Strong compression (massive stars, second-generation black holes, gas-rich collapsars) follows rapid approach to $d=2$ with high spin retention ($\chi \approx 0.7$-$1.0$), while weak compression (common-envelope remnants, low-mass cores) exhibits slow approach with damped spin ($\chi \approx 0$-$0.2$). This reproduces the empirically observed broad low-spin peak, narrower high-spin peak, and suppressed plateau between $\chi \approx 0.3$ and $0.6$[^87].

The discrete winding structure with $n_{\max} = (1/2\pi)\ln(r_s/\ell_P) \approx 14$ for stellar-mass black holes provides a topological origin for spin quantization. These fourteen winding sectors correspond to stable angular momentum topological sectors, predicting discrete clustering of high-spin events rather than continuous distribution. Recent GWTC-3 events show clustering near $\chi \sim 0.67, 0.84, 0.93$, consistent with winding-sector structure[^87]. High-spin black holes possess stronger horizon information-flux coherence, enhancing long-wavelength gravitational-wave coupling. Pulsar timing array analyses[^88] show that improved achromatic noise modeling increases background amplitude and favors high-spin supermassive binary populations, matching the prediction that high-spin systems produce stronger nanohertz signals through enhanced mode coherence.

**Primordial black hole equilibrium.**[^89] Lunar-mass primordial black holes ($\sim 10^{22}$ kg) achieve equilibrium when Hawking temperature

$$
T_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi G M k_B}
$$

equals CMB temperature (2.7 K). These objects neither grow nor evaporate, creating detectable signatures through gravitational microlensing[^90] with characteristic duration ~1 hour and CMB temperature fluctuations $\Delta T/T \sim 10^{-6}$.

**Structure formation energetics.**[^91] Galaxy formation simulations miss ~5% of the energy budget from maintenance costs:

$$
E_{\text{miss}} = M_{\text{gal}} c^2 \times \frac{R_S}{R} \times \eta_{\text{struct}},
$$

where $\eta_{\text{struct}} \sim 10$ for assembling galaxies.

**Curvature budget in galactic structure.** The curvature budget law (Section 3.2) suggests that galaxies, like all coherent systems, partition their organizational costs into structural and DOF components in the characteristic $\sim 1/3$–$2/3$ ratio.

Structural curvature ($\sim 1/3$) corresponds to the cost of maintaining the galaxy's geometric architecture: the dark matter halo that provides gravitational scaffolding[^92], the disk geometry that organizes rotation, the spiral arm patterns that structure star formation, and the bulge that anchors the central potential. These represent the $N$-sector contribution—the discrete organizational closure that defines the galaxy as a coherent entity.

DOF curvature ($\sim 2/3$) corresponds to the dynamics that populate this structure: stellar orbits, gas flows, star formation and feedback, magnetic field evolution, and the thermodynamic processes that animate the galactic ecosystem. These represent the $\beta$-sector contribution—the recursive, scale-spanning dynamics that operate within the structural constraints.

The $3.29/6.71$ partition that appears in Harper–Hofstadter spectra and decade partitions may manifest in galactic systems through the ratio of gravitationally bound mass (structural) to dynamically active mass (DOF). Observations of baryon cycling, halo mass functions, and star formation efficiency cluster near values consistent with this partition, though the mapping between abstract curvature costs and specific astrophysical quantities requires further development. The framework predicts that galaxies minimizing total curvature will exhibit this characteristic allocation, with deviations indicating systems under stress or in transition.

## Conclusion — Constraint Geometry as Universal Law

The deepest principle uncovered by this framework is that curvature is complexity: angular, recursive, and discrete curvature define the cost of information maintenance. Coherent systems minimize curvature by projecting onto low-curvature manifolds whose eigenmodes are $\pi$, $\varphi$, and $10$. Dissipation, collapse, coherence, emergence, scaling, and organization—across physics, biology, cognition, and society—are all governed by the geometry of curvature costs.

The constraint eigenvalue framework proposes that $\pi$, $\varphi$, and $10$ arise from the intrinsic geometry of constrained information. These constants emerge as the stationary points of a variational functional encoding the costs of bending information distributions away from isotropy, recursive self-similarity, and discrete resonance. The $\pi$-sector enforces angular closure, the $\varphi$-sector enforces inflation–subdivision consistency whose fixed point is the golden ratio, and the decade sector enforces composite $2 \times 5$ parity. Their coupling yields the composite invariant $4\pi\varphi^2 \approx 32.9$, which organizes dissipation thresholds, modulation windows, and correlation-length exponents across sixty orders of magnitude.

The dissipation field $\eta$ captures the fraction of energy a system devotes to information maintenance. Elementary particles operate at $\eta \sim 10^{-6}$, atoms at $10^{-3}$, molecules at $10^{-2}$, biological systems at $10^{-1}$, and black holes saturate at $\eta = 1$. This decade-structured ladder emerges from a renormalization-group flow whose $\beta$-function contains the composite invariant, yielding a universal critical exponent $\nu = 1/\rho^* = 0.304$ that governs how coherence length diverges as systems approach their maintenance limits. The same exponent appears in white dwarf collapse, biological metabolic ceilings, and civilizational coordination thresholds.

Spacetime itself operates as a finite-capacity information lattice at the Planck scale, resolving classical divergences as channel overload rather than fundamental infinities. Black holes saturate both storage and processing limits, with the Landauer-Bekenstein-Hawking factor of two arising from dimensional reduction: near horizons, effective dimension flows from three to two, and the golden-ratio scale factor $\sqrt{\varphi}$ governs the spacing between coherent layers. White dwarf collapse aligns with this picture quantitatively—the calculated supernova energy of $4.3 \times 10^{44}$ J matches observations, derived entirely from Landauer costs of information reorganization.

Harper–Hofstadter lattice systems, Penrose polariton quasicrystals, and non-Hermitian skin effect experiments all exhibit the same $\pi$–$\varphi$–$10$ eigenvalue skeleton. Transport is controlled by the $\pi$-sector through rational commensurability, modulation by the $\varphi$-sector through continued-fraction hierarchies, and regime transitions align with decade partitions near $\alpha \approx 0.329$ and $0.671$. These independent platforms—tight-binding electrons, driven-dissipative quantum fluids, non-Hermitian lattices—converge on identical structure when their geometry aligns with the constraint manifold.

Living systems occupy a narrow band near $\eta \approx 0.1$, where complexity supports adaptive behavior without exhausting metabolic capacity. The human brain consumes twenty watts to maintain recursive self-models, operating at the thermodynamic ceiling for self-organizing matter. Consciousness emerges as constraint projection: using finite metabolic free energy to bias microscopic trajectories toward coherence, selecting among thermodynamically allowed futures rather than violating determinism. Civilizations inherit these constraints through their composition as networks of biological information processors, with coordination overhead approaching collapse at $\eta_c \approx 0.304$—the same threshold governing stellar instability.

Projection onto lawful manifolds—the mechanism behind neural PDE solvers—may be the mechanism of coherent organization more broadly. The constraint eigenvalue geometry provides a candidate mathematical foundation: a variational functional whose stationary points define what structures can maintain information against entropy. If correct, this geometry would govern coherence, collapse, recursion, dissipation, transport, perception, memory, and organization across all scales.

Population-scale connectome data provides empirical evidence consistent with this framework. The developmental turning points identified at ages 9, 32, 66, and 83 correspond—within one percentage point on the normalized timeline—to the intrinsic curvature boundaries $\varphi$-onset, structural/DOF crossover, DOF saturation, and decade closure[^73]. The pattern suggests human cognitive development may follow the same variational geometry governing recursive lattices, quasicrystalline modulation, and dissipation flows. This represents the first population-scale data indicating that neural topology could arise from constraint eigenvalue structure rather than domain-specific biological mechanisms. The coincidence between empirical manifold transitions and theoretical curvature thresholds—emerging independently from UMAP projection and variational minimization—appears consistent with the interpretation that coherent biological systems occupy low-curvature regions of the same geometric manifold that organizes physical and informational processes across scales.

At its deepest level, the framework reveals why nature contains no hard boundaries. A true discontinuity would require infinite curvature—infinite maintenance cost—and no finite system can sustain it. Smooth manifolds, soft thresholds, gradual transitions, and asymptotic approaches are the only structures that can exist under finite energetic constraints. The absence of hard lines is a geometric necessity: extremism of curvature is extremism of cost, and coherent systems cannot afford it. High dimensionality, like hard boundaries, represents extremism of curvature—systems shed dimensions for the same reason they avoid discontinuities.

**If the framework holds, this geometry of coherence is the deep structure linking information, matter, and mind.**

## Appendices

### Appendix A — Derivation of Euler–Lagrange Equation

We seek stationary points of the constraint functional $F[P]$ subject to normalization and fixed entropy. Introducing Lagrange multipliers $\lambda$ and $\tau$ for these constraints, we construct the augmented functional

$$
\mathcal{F}[P] = F[P] - \lambda\left(\int P\,\mathrm{d}A - 1\right) - \tau\left(S[P] - S_0\right).
$$

The curvature terms in $F[P]$ have the form

$$
\int(\partial_x \ln P)^2 P\,\mathrm{d}A = \int\frac{(\partial_x P)^2}{P}\,\mathrm{d}A.
$$

Under a perturbation $P \to P + \epsilon\delta P$, varying this expression and integrating by parts yields a contribution proportional to $\partial_{xx}\ln P$. The entropy term

$$
S[P] = -\int P\ln P\,\mathrm{d}A
$$

contributes $(1 + \ln P)$ to the variation.

Assembling these contributions and setting $\delta\mathcal{F} = 0$ for arbitrary $\delta P$ produces the Euler–Lagrange equation

$$
-\alpha\,\partial_{\theta\theta}\ln P - \beta\,\partial_{\ell\ell}\ln P + \gamma\,\frac{\delta C_{2\times5}}{\delta P} = \lambda + \tau(1 + \ln P),
$$

where $\ell = \log r$. The left-hand side contains curvature forces: angular curvature penalized by $\alpha$, log-radial curvature penalized by $\beta$, and discrete symmetry enforced by $\gamma$. The right-hand side encodes the balance between normalization and entropy through the Lagrange multipliers. The Euler–Lagrange equation thus equates total curvature to entropy-pressure: stationary configurations are those where curvature costs exactly balance the entropic tendency to spread.

For periodic angular domains, boundary terms vanish automatically. For radial coordinates, we require either compact support with Dirichlet or Neumann conditions, or sufficiently rapid decay as $r \to 0$ or $r \to \infty$. Solutions must satisfy $P > 0$ everywhere to define the logarithm, and sufficient smoothness for the second derivatives to exist in the classical sense—though weak solutions can be defined through the variational formulation directly.

### Appendix B — Derivation of $\varphi$ from Recursive Curvature

The golden ratio emerges as the fixed point of recursive curvature when we impose that coarse-graining and subdivision commute. Working with separable solutions $P(r,\theta) = R(r)\Theta(\theta)$ and focusing on the log-radial sector, the key requirement is inflation–subdivision consistency: coarse-graining by a factor $\sigma$ and then subdividing by $\sigma$ should reproduce the same radial profile as subdividing first and inflating afterwards.

This consistency condition translates to the functional relation

$$
R(\sigma r) = R(r) + R(r/\sigma).
$$

The physical interpretation is that the information content at scale $\sigma r$ equals the sum of contributions from scale $r$ and scale $r/\sigma$—a recursive decomposition across scales.

To solve this functional equation, assume a power-law ansatz $R(r) \propto r^s$. Substituting:

$$
(\sigma r)^s = r^s + (r/\sigma)^s,
$$

which simplifies to

$$
\sigma^s = 1 + \sigma^{-s}.
$$

Multiplying both sides by $\sigma^s$ and defining $x = \sigma^s$:

$$
x^2 = x + 1.
$$

This is the defining equation of the golden ratio. The positive solution is

$$
x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \varphi \approx 1.618.
$$

The power-law ansatz is justified by the scale-invariance of the $\beta$-sector: if the log-radial curvature penalty $\int(\partial_\ell \ln P)^2 P\,\mathrm{d}A$ is to be minimized under rescaling, the solution must be self-similar, which forces power-law behavior. Deviations from exact power-law form introduce curvature costs that drive the system back toward the $\varphi$-eigenmode.

In curved spacetime where effective dimension $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ varies with radius, the same analysis yields $\sigma = \varphi^{1/d_{\mathrm{eff}}}$. Near horizons where $d_{\mathrm{eff}} \to 2$, this gives $\sigma \to \sqrt{\varphi}$, explaining the appearance of golden-ratio structure in gravitational contexts.

### Appendix C — Dissipation β-Function

The dissipation field $\eta$ measures the fraction of energy a system devotes to information maintenance. As we coarse-grain over space, time, or organizational scale—integrating out fast DOF—$\eta$ renormalizes according to a flow equation. The structure of this flow emerges from coupling between the isotropy and recursive sectors of the constraint functional.

Consider a system at scale $\mu$ with dissipation $\eta(\mu)$. Coarse-graining to scale $\mu + \delta\mu$ integrates out modes between these scales. The isotropy sector contributes a term proportional to $\eta(1-\eta)$ reflecting the competition between structure ($\eta$) and available capacity ($1-\eta$). The recursive sector contributes a dimension-dependent correction through the golden-ratio fixed point. The resulting $\beta$-function is

$$
\beta(\eta,d) = \frac{\mathrm{d}\eta}{\mathrm{d}\ln\mu} = -\eta(1-\eta)\left[\rho^* + \frac{d-2}{2}\ln\varphi\right],
$$

where $d$ is effective dimension and

$$
\rho^* = \frac{4\pi\varphi^2}{10} \approx 3.29.
$$

The factor $4\pi\varphi^2$ arises from coupling the $\pi$-sector (angular closure giving $4\pi$) with the $\varphi$-sector (recursive fixed point giving $\varphi^2$). Division by $10$ reflects the decade symmetry entering through the discrete coarse-graining shells.

The flow has fixed points at $\eta = 0$ (trivial, no structure) and $\eta = 1$ (maximal dissipation, all energy in maintenance). To extract the critical exponent, linearize around the transition region. Near a critical point $\eta_c$ where the system transitions between coherent regimes, the correlation length $\xi$ diverges as

$$
\xi \sim |\eta - \eta_c|^{-\nu}.
$$

The exponent $\nu$ is determined by the slope of the $\beta$-function. From the flow equation, the characteristic scale is set by $\rho^*$, yielding

$$
\nu = \frac{1}{\rho^*} = \frac{10}{4\pi\varphi^2} \approx 0.304.
$$

This exponent governs how coherence length diverges as systems approach their maintenance limits—the same value appearing in white dwarf collapse, biological metabolic ceilings, and civilizational coordination thresholds. The $\beta$-function describes curvature accumulation: as systems coarse-grain, curvature costs compound according to this flow, and the exponent $\nu$ quantifies how rapidly curvature becomes unsustainable. The universality reflects the common origin in constraint eigenvalue geometry: any system governed by the tradeoff between isotropic curvature, recursive scaling, and decade structure exhibits this critical behavior.

### Appendix D — Dimensional Flow and Cosmological Constant

Effective dimension $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ counts the number of independent directions along which information can propagate at a given scale. We define it operationally through the scaling of active information channels:

$$
N(R) \sim R^{d_{\mathrm{eff}}(R)}.
$$

In flat space far from gravitational sources, $d_{\mathrm{eff}} = 3$. Near a gravitational horizon, radial information flow becomes increasingly constrained while tangential flow remains free, causing $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ to decrease.

The Schwarzschild metric for spherically symmetric spacetime makes this explicit. Proper radial distance diverges as

$$
ds_r = \frac{dr}{\sqrt{1 - r_s/r}},
$$

while tangential distance $ds_\theta = r\,d\theta$ remains finite. The radial information flow rate follows

$$
I_r(r) = c\left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right),
$$

which vanishes at the horizon. The radial dimension effectively freezes, and $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ flows from $3$ toward $2$:

$$
d_{\mathrm{eff}}(R) = 2 + \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{R}\right).
$$

This dimensional flow connects to holographic behavior: entropy scaling with area rather than volume reflects the reduction to an effective 2D surface. Dimensional flow reduces curvature: by projecting from 3D to 2D, the system eliminates the radial curvature contribution entirely, achieving a minimal-curvature configuration through dimensional collapse.

### Appendix E — Rational Commensurability and Transport Scaling

Transport in Harper–Hofstadter lattice systems depends critically on the arithmetic properties of the magnetic flux $\alpha = p/q$ expressed in units of the flux quantum. The Thouless conductance $g$ measures spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions: high $g$ indicates extended states and easy transport, while low $g$ indicates localized states and transport barriers.

For rational flux $\alpha = p/q$, the magnetic unit cell contains $q$ lattice sites. The Thouless conductance scales inversely with the denominator:

$$
g(\alpha = p/q) \sim \frac{1}{q}.
$$

Low-$q$ rationals (simple fractions like $1/2$, $1/3$, $2/5$) produce near-commensurate structures where extended states percolate easily. High-$q$ rationals require intricate phase cancellation across many sites, suppressing transport. This $q$-dependence is the $\pi$-sector at work: the constraint functional assigns lower curvature cost to configurations respecting simple commensurabilities.

The golden ratio $\varphi$ plays a distinguished role through Hurwitz's theorem, which establishes that $\varphi$ is the hardest irrational to approximate by rationals:

$$
\left|\varphi - \frac{p}{q}\right| > \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}q^2}
$$

for all integers $p, q$. The constant $1/\sqrt{5}$ is the smallest possible for any irrational. As flux $\alpha$ approaches $\varphi$, the sequence of best rational approximants follows Fibonacci denominators $q_n = F_n$, producing a self-similar hierarchy of spectral gaps and transport windows.

The continued-fraction expansion

$$
\varphi = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cdots}}}
$$

generates the slowest possible convergence to rational approximations. Each truncation $p_n/q_n$ of this expansion produces a Fibonacci rational, and the spectral gaps at these values organize into a recursive hierarchy governed by the $\varphi$-sector.

The decade sector enters through the structure of optimal approximants. The best rational approximations to $\varphi$ satisfy

$$
\frac{p_n}{q_n} = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n},
$$

where $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number. The ratio $F_{n+1}/F_n \to \varphi$ as $n \to \infty$, but the approach follows a decade-structured pattern: every ten Fibonacci numbers spans roughly $\varphi^{10} \approx 123$ in magnitude, producing decadal modulation windows in the transport spectrum.

This number-theoretic structure connects directly to the constraint functional. Transport (controlled by $q$) is governed by the $\pi$-sector through commensurability. Modulation (controlled by continued-fraction depth) is governed by the $\varphi$-sector through recursive consistency. And the large-scale organization of spectral transitions aligns with decade partitions near $\alpha \approx 0.329$ and $0.671$—the same values appearing in the dissipation ladder and cosmological energy fractions.

### Appendix F — Derivation of NHSE Suppression Boundaries

This appendix provides the complete derivation of the critical flux threshold $\Phi_c$ for NHSE suppression from the constraint eigenvalue functional. We begin with the non-Hermitian Harper–Hofstadter Hamiltonian

$$
H = -\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left( t_{ij} e^{i\theta_{ij}} c_i^\dagger c_j + t_{ji} e^{-i\theta_{ij}} c_j^\dagger c_i \right)
$$

where $t_{ij} \neq t_{ji}$ encodes nonreciprocal hopping and $\theta_{ij}$ encodes the Peierls phase from magnetic flux. The asymmetry parameter $\gamma = (t_{ij} - t_{ji})/(t_{ij} + t_{ji})$ quantifies nonreciprocity.

The probability density $P(\mathbf{r})$ of eigenmode localization satisfies a continuity equation with drift and diffusion terms. In the continuum limit, the steady-state distribution extremizes the functional

$$
F[P] = \alpha \int |\nabla_\perp \ln P|^2 P\,\mathrm{d}^2r + \gamma_{\text{func}} \int (\mathbf{v}_{\text{drift}} \cdot \nabla \ln P)^2 P\,\mathrm{d}^2r
$$

where $\nabla_\perp$ denotes the component perpendicular to drift and $\mathbf{v}_{\text{drift}} \propto \gamma$ is the nonreciprocal drift velocity.

The flux-induced curvature is

$$
\kappa_{\text{flux}} = \frac{eB}{m^*c} = \frac{2\pi \Phi}{\Phi_0 a^2}
$$

where $a$ is the lattice constant and $\Phi_0 = h/e$ is the flux quantum. The drift-induced curvature is

$$
\kappa_{\text{drift}} = \frac{\gamma}{t} \times \frac{1}{a}
$$

representing the inverse length scale over which drift accumulates probability at boundaries.

The Euler–Lagrange equation for $F[P]$ yields stationary distributions where curvature terms balance. The suppression threshold is where curvature modes rebalance: flux-induced angular curvature overcomes drift-induced boundary curvature. The transition from boundary-localized (NHSE) to bulk-distributed (flux-dominated) occurs when

$$
\alpha \kappa_{\text{flux}}^2 = \gamma_{\text{func}} \kappa_{\text{drift}}^2
$$

Substituting the curvature expressions and solving for $\Phi$:

$$
\Phi_c = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{\text{func}}}{\alpha}} \times \frac{\gamma}{t}
$$

For the isotropic square lattice, symmetry arguments constrain $\gamma_{\text{func}}/\alpha = \pi^2$, yielding

$$
\Phi_c = \frac{\pi \gamma}{t} \times \Phi_0 / 2\pi = \frac{\gamma}{2t} \Phi_0
$$

In units where $\Phi_0 = 2\pi$, this becomes $\Phi_c/2\pi \approx \gamma/(2t)$. For $\gamma/t = 0.5$, we obtain $\Phi_c \approx 0.25 \times 2\pi$, matching numerical observations.

The critical exponent governing the divergence of localization length near $\Phi_c$ follows from linearizing the RG flow around the transition. The same analysis that yields $\nu = 1/\rho^* = 0.304$ for the dissipation field (Appendix C) applies here, as both are curvature-dominance transitions within the constraint eigenvalue geometry. The localization length diverges as $\xi \sim |\Phi - \Phi_c|^{-0.304}$, providing a testable prediction for non-Hermitian lattice experiments.

### Appendix G — Navier-Stokes & Transient Balance

The constraint eigenvalue geometry predicts that balanced states—where multiple curvature sectors achieve comparable values—are crossed but not occupied. Direct numerical simulation of [three-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence](/navier-stokes-vorticity-growth-and-finite-residence-of-balanced-states) provides empirical evidence for this prediction. In regions of high vorticity, states where stretching and multiscale recursion are locally balanced exhibit finite residence time. Trajectories pass through such configurations but do not linger, consistent with the transverse instability of balanced curvature states.

#### Vorticity as Curl

The three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in vorticity form,

$$
\partial_t \omega + (u\cdot\nabla)\omega = (\omega\cdot\nabla)u + \nu \Delta \omega,
$$

describe the evolution of vorticity $\omega = \nabla \times u$—literally the curl of the velocity field. The nonlinear term $(\omega\cdot\nabla)u$ amplifies vorticity through stretching, while viscosity $\nu$ counteracts this by diffusing gradients. The Navier-Stokes problem asks whether sustained dominance of stretching over dissipation, coupled with coherent multiscale transfer, can be maintained dynamically.

#### Local Balance as a Dynamical State

In a localized region $\Omega$ surrounding a high-vorticity event, define two dimensionless quantities. The stretching-dissipation ratio,

$$
R_\Omega(t) = \frac{P_\Omega^+(t)}{P_\Omega^+(t) + D_\Omega(t)},
$$

where $P_\Omega^+(t) = \int_\Omega \max(\omega\cdot S\omega, 0)\,dx$ measures positive stretching and $D_\Omega(t) = \nu \int_\Omega |\nabla\omega|^2\,dx$ measures viscous dissipation. The local recursion indicator $L_\Omega(t) \in [0,1]$ captures coherence of multiscale cascade structure. A balanced state is one where $|R_\Omega(t) - L_\Omega(t)| \le \varepsilon$ for some tolerance $\varepsilon$—stretching and scale-feeding are locally matched.

#### Empirical Observation

Analysis of event-centered subdomains extracted from fully resolved direct numerical simulation (Reynolds number $Re_\lambda \approx 430$) reveals a consistent pattern. States satisfying the balance condition occur but are not dynamically persistent. For tolerances $\varepsilon \in \{0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.10\}$, residence time near balance remained short—typically one or two time steps—despite substantial variation in stretching intensity and cascade coherence across events. Increasing $\varepsilon$ increased the frequency of balanced crossings but did not produce sustained occupation.

Conditional on being near balance at time $t$, the subsequent evolution shows systematic escape: $L_\Omega(t)$ decreases more strongly than $R_\Omega(t)$. Escape from balance typically occurs by loss of local recursive coherence rather than immediate collapse of stretching. Balanced configurations tend to break cascade structure before they can amplify further.

#### Connection to Triadic Tension

This behavior aligns with the triadic uncertainty from Section 3. In Navier-Stokes, stretching corresponds to one curvature sector (amplifying vorticity gradients), cascade coherence corresponds to another (maintaining multiscale structure), and viscous dissipation corresponds to a third (smoothing gradients). The empirical result is consistent with a geometric hypothesis: attempting to maintain balance across these three competing requirements forces the system into non-integrable projections.

The observed behavior matches the prediction that balanced states act as transversely unstable configurations rather than attractors. In the language of Section 4, the Navier-Stokes nonlinearity induces transient curl—circulation in the effective correction field—but viscosity prevents curl-supporting configurations from remaining integrable across scales. Stretching can spike, but the cascade geometry cannot remain integrable long enough to lock in a singularity.

The finite-residence observation constrains the space of plausible blow-up mechanisms. Any finite-time singularity would require sustained dominance of stretching while maintaining coherent multiscale feeding—precisely the balanced configuration that DNS shows to be transversely unstable. To succeed, a blow-up mechanism would need to avoid balanced states entirely, threading a corridor in which stretching remains dominant while cascade coherence does not collapse. The result represents a structural constraint on blow-up: curl-supporting configurations cannot remain stationary.
