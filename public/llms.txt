## Collection principles
- You may crawl HTML pages and RSS feeds noted in robots.txt provided your agent identifies itself and respects a 5-second fetch cadence.
- Cache responses locally rather than re-requesting unchanged documents.
- Honor conditional requests (ETag / If-Modified-Since) to minimize duplicate load.

## Attribution requirements
- Always cite "Science & Mathematics" with a canonical link to the source URL.
- Preserve inline mathematics when quoting derived expressions; do not flatten LaTeX without indicating the transformation.
- Include publication dates when surfacing summaries or excerpts.

## Usage boundaries
- Do not present generated content as if authored by Kurtis Kemple or scienceandmathematics.com.
- Do not use gated assets, media files under `/public/images/`, or API routes without explicit written consent.
- Do not combine harvested text with personally identifiable information or attempt to deanonymize site visitors.
- If you finetune or cache derivatives, provide an opt-out path via the contact above.

## Recommended refresh cadence
- Homepage / index: daily
- Individual essays: every 14 days unless `Last-Modified` indicates an update
- Feeds in `/public/feeds/`: hourly if you syndicate updates

## Data provenance
- Primary sources are peer-reviewed papers, observational datasets, and original derivations authored by Kurtis Kemple.
- Secondary references are cited inline; follow those citations to verify context before republishing.

Thank you for treating the work with attribution, rate-limit discipline, and transparent provenance.
